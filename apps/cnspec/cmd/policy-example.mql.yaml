    title: Ensure SSH MaxAuthTries is set to 4 or less
    mql: sshd.config.params.MaxAuthTries <= 4
    docs:
      desc: |
        The MaxAuthTries parameter specifies the maximum number of authentication attempts permitted per connection.
        When the login failure count reaches half the number, error messages will be written to the syslog file
        detailing the login failure.
      audit: Run the `sshd -T | grep maxauthtries` command and verify that output MaxAuthTries is 4 or less
      remediation: |
        Open your `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` and set `MaxAuthTries` to `4`.
