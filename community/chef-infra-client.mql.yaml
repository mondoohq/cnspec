      desc: Chef Infra Client is released once a year in April and 2 major versions are supported at any time (N-1). Prior releases do not receive security updates and should not be used in production environments. See the [Chef Supported Versions documentation](https://docs.chef.io/versions/) for an up-to-date list of supported Infra Client releases.
      remediation: Upgrade to a non-EOL release of Chef Infra Client. Note that this will require validation of cookbook content for compatibility as newer major version releases introduce breaking changes.

      remediation: To set the Infra Client to only accept encrypted data bags v3 or above set `data_bag_decrypt_minimum_version 3` in the `client.rb` file.

      if (file("/etc/chef/client.rb").exists) {
        file("/etc/chef/client.rb").content.contains("data_collector.token") == false
      }
    docs:
      desc: When sending reporting data directly to Automate an Automate API token must be stored in the `client.rb` configuration file. Instead of setting the token, proxy Infra Client report data through the Infra Server so that the Automate API token only needs to be stored in the Infra Server.
      remediation: See https://docs.chef.io/server/config_rb_server_optional_settings/#data_collector-14 for more information on configuring the Infra Server to proxy reporting data. Once the Infra Server has been configured for proxying you can set `data_collector.server_url` in client.rb to the URL of the Infra Server and remove the `data_collector.token` configuration.
