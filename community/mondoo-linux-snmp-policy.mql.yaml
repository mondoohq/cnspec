        Linux Server SNMP Policy by Mondoo provides guidance for vulnerable SNMP configurations on Linux hosts.

        ## Local scan

        Local scan refer to scans of files and operating systems where cnspec is installed.

        To scan the `localhost` against this policy:

        ```bash
        cnspec scan local
        ```

        ## Remote scan

        Remote scans use cnspec providers to retrieve on-demand scan results without having to install any agents.

        ### Prerequisites

        Remote scans of Linux hosts requires authentication such as SSH keys.

        ### Scan a remote Linux host (SSH authentication)

        ```bash
        cnspec scan ssh <user>@<IP_ADDRESS> -i /path/to/ssh_key
        ```

        The file `/var/lib/snmp/snmpd.conf` contains user password hashes which can be as weak as MD5.
        Note: So far this only work for Debian-based OS.
      remediation: |
        Run these commands to set proper permissions on your `/var/lib/snmp/snmpd.conf` file:

        ```bash
        chmod 640 /var/lib/snmp/snmpd.conf
        ```
