        The Mondoo Azure Security policy is designed to identify critical misconfigurations that could leave your Azure infrastructure vulnerable to attackers. This policy helps organizations detect and remediate security risks before they can be exploited, reducing the likelihood of unauthorized access, data breaches, privilege escalation, and operational disruptions.

        This policy provides security checks across key Azure services, uncovering misconfigurations that could put critical resources at risk, particularly those exposed to the public internet:

        - App Service
        - Azure Cache for Redis
        - Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)
        - Compute (virtual machines and disks)
        - Key Vault (keys, secrets, and certificates)
        - Microsoft Defender for Cloud
        - Network (security groups and watchers)
        - SQL Database, PostgreSQL, MySQL, and MariaDB
        - Storage (accounts and data protection)

        ## Join the community!

        Our goal is to build policies that are simple to deploy, accurate, and actionable. This policy is open-source and we welcome contributions from the community, whether it's adding new checks, refining existing ones, or providing feedback.

    title: Ensure OS Disks in azure virtual machines are encrypted with Customer Managed Keys (CMK)
    impact: 80

    docs:
      desc: |
        This check ensures that OS disks for Azure virtual machines are encrypted, which is critical for securing boot volumes from unauthorized access and data breaches. The use of Customer Managed Keys (CMK) offers enhanced control over the encryption and decryption processes, allowing organizations to manage their own keys via Azure Key Vault. This approach not only meets compliance requirements but also provides a higher level of security by enabling key rotation and revocation capabilities. Encrypting OS disks ensures that the data is unreadable to unauthorized users, protecting it from both external attacks and insider threats. Customer managed keys can be either Azure Disk Encryption (ADE) or server-side encryption (SSE).

        **Why this matters**

        Encrypting OS disks with Customer Managed Keys provides several critical security benefits:

        - **Data protection**: Encryption ensures that data on the OS disk is unreadable to unauthorized users, protecting it from both external attacks and insider threats.
        - **Enhanced control**: Using CMK allows organizations to manage their own encryption keys via Azure Key Vault, enabling key rotation and revocation capabilities.
        - **Compliance alignment**: Many regulatory standards and security frameworks require encryption of data at rest, and CMK provides additional control to meet stringent compliance requirements.
        - **Risk mitigation**: Encrypting boot volumes prevents unauthorized access to sensitive system data in scenarios such as disk theft or improper decommissioning.

        By ensuring OS disks are encrypted with Customer Managed Keys, this check helps to protect sensitive data, meet compliance requirements, and enhance the overall security posture of Azure virtual machines.
      audit: |
        **Manual Audit via Azure Portal:**

        1. Navigate to **Virtual machines** in the Azure Portal.
        2. Select a virtual machine and access **Disks** under the Settings menu.
        3. Verify the encryption settings for the OS disk to ensure it uses CMK.

        **Automated Audit with Azure CLI:**

        List and check the encryption settings for all disks in a specific resource group:

        ```bash
        az disk list --resource-group "yourResourceGroupName" --query "[].{Name:name, ResourceGroupName:resourceGroup, EncryptionSettings:encryptionSettingsCollection}" -o table
        ```

        **Automated Audit with PowerShell:**

        ```powershell
        Get-AzDisk -ResourceGroupName "yourResourceGroupName" | Select-Object Name, ResourceGroupName, EncryptionSettingsCollection
        ```

        Ensure the EncryptionType is set to EncryptionAtRestWithCustomerKey for OS disks.

        This check ensures that SSH access (port 22) is restricted from the internet to minimize security risks.

        **Why this matters**

        Exposing SSH access to the internet can lead to significant security risks:

        - **Unauthorized access**: SSH is a common target for brute force and other unauthorized access attempts.
        - **Increased attack surface**: Allowing unrestricted SSH access expands the attack surface, making it easier for attackers to exploit vulnerabilities.
        - **Compliance risks**: Many security standards and best practices recommend restricting SSH access to reduce potential threats.
        - **Operational risks**: Misconfigured or exposed SSH access can lead to unintended access, service disruptions, or data breaches.

        By ensuring SSH access is restricted to known, secure sources, this check helps to minimize security vulnerabilities, align with best practices, and enhance the overall security posture of Azure resources.
      audit: |
        **Manual Audit via Azure Portal:**

          **Checking via Network Security Groups (NSGs) for All Resources:**
          1. From the main Azure Portal menu, navigate to **Network security groups**.
          2. Select an NSG associated with the resources you want to check.
          3. Go to the **Inbound security rules** section.
          4. Review all the rules to ensure none allow SSH access (port 22, TCP) from broadly defined sources such as 'Any', '0.0.0.0', or 'Internet'.
          5. Confirm that rules configured to permit SSH access are scoped to specific, known IP addresses or ranges to minimize exposure.

          **Checking Specific Virtual Machines:**
          1. Log into the Azure Portal.
          2. Navigate to **Virtual machines**.
          3. Select a specific virtual machine to review.
          4. Within the virtual machine's blade, select **Networking** under the settings menu.
          5. Access the **Networking** blade of the selected VM, then review the **Inbound port rules**.
          6. Ensure there are no rules allowing SSH access (port 22, TCP) from 'Any' or 'Internet' source address prefixes. Only secure, specified IP ranges should be allowed, if necessary.

        **Automated Audit with Azure CLI:**

        List NSGs and check for SSH access rules:

        **Manual Audit via Azure Portal:**

        1. Log into the Azure Portal.
        2. Navigate to **Network security groups** under the Networking or directly through the search bar.
        3. For each NSG, access the **Inbound security rules**.
        4. Carefully review each rule to identify any that allow inbound RDP traffic (TCP port 3389):
          - Check for rules where the protocol is set to `TCP`.
          - The destination port or port range includes `3389`.
          - The source address prefix is too broad, such as 'Any', '0.0.0.0', '<nw>/0', '/0', 'internet', or 'any'.
        5. Note down any NSG rules that do not comply with your organization's security policy regarding restricted access to RDP. These rules should ideally allow access only from trusted, secure networks, and not from the open internet.

        This check ensures that VNC access (port 5900) is restricted from the internet to minimize security risks.

        **Why this matters**

        Exposing VNC access to the internet can lead to significant security risks:

        - **Unauthorized access**: VNC is a common target for brute force and other unauthorized access attempts.
        - **Increased attack surface**: Allowing unrestricted VNC access expands the attack surface, making it easier for attackers to exploit vulnerabilities.
        - **Compliance risks**: Many security standards and best practices recommend restricting VNC access to reduce potential threats.
        - **Operational risks**: Misconfigured or exposed VNC access can lead to unintended access, service disruptions, or data breaches.

        By ensuring VNC access is restricted to known, secure sources, this check helps to minimize security vulnerabilities, align with best practices, and enhance the overall security posture of Azure resources.

        3. For each NSG, access the **Inbound security rules**.
        4. Carefully review each rule to identify any that allow inbound VNC traffic (TCP port 5900):
          - Check for rules where the protocol is set to `TCP`.
          - The destination port or port range includes `5900`.
          - The source address prefix is too broad, such as 'Any', '0.0.0.0', '<nw>/0', '/0', 'internet', or 'any'.
        5. Note down any NSG rules that do not comply with your organization's security policy regarding restricted access to VNC. These rules should ideally allow access only from trusted, secure networks, and not from the open internet.

        1. Navigate to **Virtual Machines** in the Azure Portal.

            **Using PowerShell**

            To set the default network access rule to "Deny" for a new storage account, use the following PowerShell command:

            ```powershell
            New-AzStorageAccount -ResourceGroupName <ResourceGroupName> -Name <StorageAccountName> -Location <Location> -SkuName Standard_LRS -Kind StorageV2 -DefaultAction Deny
            ```

            This command updates the storage account to deny all traffic by default, significantly enhancing the security posture by limiting access to only configured exceptions.

        This check ensures that Azure SQL servers have an audit log retention policy set to at least 30 days.

        **Why this matters**

        Maintaining audit logs for an extended period is crucial for compliance and security analysis:

        - **Compliance requirements**: Many regulatory standards mandate retaining audit logs for a minimum duration to ensure traceability and accountability.
        - **Security incident analysis**: Historical audit logs help identify patterns and investigate potential security threats or breaches over time.
        - **Operational integrity**: Retaining logs for at least 30 days ensures that organizations have sufficient data to analyze and address operational anomalies.
        - **Forensic investigations**: Extended retention periods provide critical data for forensic investigations in the event of a security incident.

        By enforcing a minimum retention policy of 30 days, this check helps organizations comply with regulatory requirements, enhance their security posture, and maintain operational resilience.

        This check ensures that SQL databases across various platforms (Azure SQL, PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB) do not permit unrestricted network access by blocking ingress from the IP address range "0.0.0.0/0".

        **Why this matters**

        Allowing unrestricted network access to SQL databases can lead to significant security risks:

        - **Unauthorized access**: Open access from "0.0.0.0/0" allows any IP address to connect, increasing the likelihood of unauthorized access.
        - **Increased attack surface**: Exposing databases to the internet unnecessarily expands the attack surface, making it easier for attackers to exploit vulnerabilities.
        - **Compliance risks**: Many security standards and best practices recommend restricting access to sensitive resources to reduce potential threats.
        - **Operational risks**: Misconfigured or exposed databases can lead to unintended access, data breaches, or service disruptions.

        By ensuring that ingress from "0.0.0.0/0" is blocked, this check helps to minimize security vulnerabilities, align with best practices, and enhance the overall security posture of Azure environments.

        This check ensures that Managed Identities are enabled for Azure App Services to securely authenticate with Microsoft Entra ID.

        **Why this matters**

        Enabling Managed Identities for Azure App Services provides several security and operational benefits:

        - **Eliminates credential storage**: Managed Identities remove the need to store sensitive credentials within the application, reducing the risk of credential theft.
        - **Streamlined authentication**: Applications can directly authenticate to Azure services like Azure SQL Database, Azure Storage, and Azure Key Vault without requiring manual credential management.
        - **Enhanced security**: Managed Identities are tied to the application and managed by Azure, ensuring secure and seamless authentication.
        - **Compliance alignment**: Many security standards recommend minimizing the use of hardcoded credentials to reduce potential attack vectors.

        By enabling Managed Identities, this check helps to enhance the security posture of Azure App Services, align with best practices, and simplify authentication workflows.

        This check ensures that activity log alerts are configured for the creation, update, and deletion of network security groups to monitor changes and detect suspicious activities.

        **Why this matters**

        Monitoring activity log alerts for network security group changes provides several critical benefits:

        - **Unauthorized access detection**: Alerts help identify unauthorized or unexpected changes to network security groups, which could indicate a potential security breach.
        - **Increased visibility**: Tracking changes to network security groups ensures that administrators are aware of modifications that could impact the security posture of the environment.
        - **Compliance alignment**: Many security standards and best practices require monitoring and alerting on changes to critical network configurations.
        - **Operational integrity**: Detecting and responding to unauthorized changes helps maintain the intended security and operational state of the network.

        By ensuring activity log alerts are configured for these events, this check helps to enhance security monitoring, align with compliance requirements, and maintain the overall security posture of Azure environments.

        **Manual Audit via Azure Portal:**

        1. Navigate to the `Monitor` blade.
        2. Select `Alerts`.
        3. In the Alerts window, select `Alert rules`.
        4. Verify that alert rules exist for the following conditions:
          - Operation name equals `Microsoft.Network/networkSecurityGroups/write` for Create/Update events.
          - Operation name equals `Microsoft.Network/networkSecurityGroups/delete` for Delete events.
        5. Select the alert rule name to review its configuration.
          - Ensure the `Condition` panel specifies the correct operation names and does not filter on irrelevant criteria like `Level`, `Status`, or `Caller`.
          - Confirm that the `Actions` panel is set up to notify the appropriate personnel within your organization.

        **Automated Audit with Azure CLI:**

        Run the following commands to list the current alert rules and verify their conditions:

        ```bash
        az monitor activity-log alert list --subscription <subscription ID> --query "[].{Name:name, Enabled:enabled, Condition:condition.allOf, Actions:actions}"
        ```

        Check for the presence of conditions targeting the `Microsoft.Network/networkSecurityGroups/write` and `Microsoft.Network/networkSecurityGroups/delete` operation names in the output.

        **Using PowerShell**

        Utilize the following PowerShell commands to inspect the alert rules:

        ```powershell
        Get-AzActivityLogAlert -SubscriptionId <subscription ID> | where-object {$_.ConditionAllOf.Equal -match "Microsoft.Network/networkSecurityGroups/write"} | select-object Location, Name, Enabled, ResourceGroupName, ConditionAllOf

        Get-AzActivityLogAlert -SubscriptionId <subscription ID> | where-object {$_.ConditionAllOf.Equal -match "Microsoft.Network/networkSecurityGroups/delete"} | select-object Location, Name, Enabled, ResourceGroupName, ConditionAllOf

        This check ensures that SSL/TLS is enforced for all connections to PostgreSQL database servers to safeguard data in transit.

        **Why this matters**

        Enforcing SSL/TLS connections for PostgreSQL database servers provides several critical benefits:

        - **Data protection**: Encrypting data in transit prevents eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks, ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive information.
        - **Compliance alignment**: Many security standards and best practices mandate the use of secure communication protocols to protect data in transit.
        - **Mitigation of risks**: Disabling unencrypted connections reduces the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches.
        - **Operational integrity**: Ensuring secure connections helps maintain the trustworthiness and reliability of database operations.

        By enforcing SSL/TLS connections, this check helps to minimize security vulnerabilities, align with compliance requirements, and enhance the overall security posture of PostgreSQL database servers.

        **Manual Audit via Azure Portal:**

        1. Log in to Azure Portal at https://portal.azure.com.
        2. Navigate to `Azure Database for PostgreSQL server`.
        3. Select each database server to review its settings.
        4. Under `Connection security`, confirm that `Enforce SSL connection` is set to `ENABLED`. This setting should be consistent across all PostgreSQL database servers to ensure uniform security posture.

        **Automated Audit with Azure CLI:**

        To verify the SSL enforcement setting across all PostgreSQL servers in a resource group, you can use the Azure CLI. The expected output for compliant servers is `Enabled`:

        ```bash
        az postgres server list --resource-group <resourceGroupName> --query "[].{Name:name, SSL:sslEnforcement}" -o table
        ```

        This command provides a clear, tabulated output indicating which servers have SSL enforced and which do not, enabling quick identification of non-compliant resources.

        **Using PowerShell**

        PowerShell can also be used for a detailed audit. The command should return `Enabled` for each server checked:

        ```powershell
        Get-AzPostgreSqlServer -ResourceGroupName <ResourceGroupName> | Select-Object Name, SslEnforcement
        ```

        This command lists all PostgreSQL servers in the specified resource group along with their SSL enforcement status, providing a comprehensive overview.

        This check ensures that direct UDP access to resources from the internet is restricted to minimize security risks and prevent potential exploitation.

        **Why this matters**

        Exposing UDP services to the internet can lead to significant security risks:

        - **Reflection amplification attacks**: UDP's connectionless nature allows attackers to spoof a target's IP address and send information requests using UDP. This can result in amplified traffic directed at the victim, often leading to denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.
        - **Lack of authentication**: UDP does not verify source IP addresses, making it easier for attackers to manipulate IP datagrams and exploit open UDP ports.
        - **Increased attack surface**: Open UDP ports, especially those using well-known protocols like DNS, NTP, CLDAP, SSDP, or SNMPv2, can be exploited as amplifiers in attacks.
        - **Operational risks**: Misconfigured or exposed UDP services can lead to unintended access, service disruptions, or data breaches.

        By restricting unnecessary UDP traffic from the internet and employing best practices for network security, this check helps to minimize security vulnerabilities, align with compliance requirements, and enhance the overall security posture of Azure resources.

        **Examples of vulnerable UDP-based protocols**

        Some application-layer protocols that rely on UDP and are commonly targeted include:

        - Domain Name System (DNS)
        - Network Time Protocol (NTP)
        - Connection-less Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (CLDAP)
        - Simple Service Discovery Protocol (SSDP)
        - Simple Network Management Protocol version 2 (SNMPv2)
        - Portmap/Remote Procedure Call (RPC)
        - Network Basic Input/Output System (NetBIOS)
        - Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP)

        Employing Network Security Groups (NSGs) to deny or control inbound UDP traffic, especially on ports known to be vulnerable or unnecessary for internet exposure, is a key defensive measure. For services that require UDP access, ensure they are secured, monitored, and only exposed when absolutely necessary, using the principle of least privilege to minimize potential attack vectors.
      audit: |
        **Manual Audit via Azure Portal:**

        1. Access the Azure Portal and review the networking settings for each resource, focusing on those with public internet exposure.
        2. Inspect inbound port rules for associated Network Security Groups (NSGs) and any other relevant firewall settings.
        3. Confirm that none of the critical UDP ports are allowed from the internet, particularly for resources that do not require such access.

        **Automated Audit with Azure CLI:**

        Use the Azure CLI to review NSG rules across your Azure environment:

        ```bash
        az network nsg rule list --query "[].{NSG:networkSecurityGroup, Protocol:protocol, Access:access, Direction:direction, SourceAddressPrefix:sourceAddressPrefix, DestinationPortRange:destinationPortRange}" -o table
        ```

        Ensure no rule improperly exposes the specified UDP ports to the internet.

        This check ensures that blob soft delete is enabled for Azure Storage accounts to protect against accidental or malicious deletion of blob data.

        **Why this matters**

        Enabling blob soft delete provides several critical benefits:

        - **Data protection**: Soft delete retains deleted blobs for a specified period, allowing recovery from accidental or malicious deletions.
        - **Ransomware mitigation**: In the event of a ransomware attack that attempts to delete or overwrite data, soft delete provides a recovery mechanism.
        - **Compliance alignment**: Many regulatory standards require data retention and recoverability capabilities for critical data stores.
        - **Operational resilience**: Soft delete acts as a safety net, reducing the impact of human errors or application bugs that inadvertently delete data.

        By enabling blob soft delete, organizations can enhance their data protection posture and ensure recoverability of critical blob data.

        This check ensures that an Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) administrator is configured for Azure SQL servers, enabling centralized identity management and stronger authentication.

        **Why this matters**

        Configuring an Azure AD administrator for SQL servers provides several critical benefits:

        - **Centralized identity management**: Azure AD integration allows organizations to manage database access using the same identity provider used for other Azure resources.
        - **Stronger authentication**: Azure AD supports multi-factor authentication (MFA), conditional access policies, and other advanced security features not available with SQL authentication alone.
        - **Reduced credential sprawl**: Eliminates the need for separate SQL logins and passwords, reducing the attack surface and simplifying credential management.
        - **Compliance alignment**: Many security standards require centralized identity management and strong authentication for database access.

        By configuring an Azure AD administrator, organizations can enforce consistent access policies and leverage advanced identity security features for their SQL databases.

        This check ensures that Azure Key Vault uses Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for authorization instead of vault access policies, providing more granular and manageable access control.

        **Why this matters**

        Using RBAC authorization for Key Vault provides several critical benefits:

        - **Granular access control**: RBAC allows fine-grained permissions at the individual key, secret, and certificate level, rather than broad vault-level access policies.
        - **Centralized management**: RBAC permissions are managed through Azure's central IAM system, providing a unified view of access across all Azure resources.
        - **Audit and compliance**: RBAC integrates with Azure's audit logging, making it easier to track and review access permissions for compliance purposes.
        - **Least privilege enforcement**: RBAC's built-in and custom roles make it easier to implement the principle of least privilege compared to vault access policies.

        By using RBAC authorization, organizations can enforce more consistent and manageable access control for their Key Vault resources.

        This check ensures that auto-provisioning of the monitoring agent is enabled so that all new and existing virtual machines are automatically configured for security data collection.

        **Why this matters**

        Enabling auto-provisioning of the monitoring agent provides several critical benefits:

        - **Comprehensive coverage**: Ensures that all VMs in the subscription are monitored for security threats without manual intervention.
        - **Consistent security posture**: Eliminates gaps in monitoring that can occur when new VMs are provisioned without manual agent installation.
        - **Reduced operational burden**: Automates the deployment and configuration of monitoring agents, freeing security teams to focus on threat response.
        - **Compliance alignment**: Many security frameworks require consistent monitoring across all compute resources in the environment.

        By enabling auto-provisioning, organizations can ensure that no VM is left unmonitored and that security data collection begins immediately upon resource creation.

        This check ensures that Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is enabled on all Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters to enforce proper access control for Kubernetes resources.

        **Why this matters**

        Enabling RBAC on AKS clusters provides several critical benefits:

        - **Access control**: RBAC allows fine-grained control over who can perform what actions within the Kubernetes cluster, enforcing the principle of least privilege.
        - **Reduced attack surface**: Without RBAC, any authenticated user may have unrestricted access to all cluster resources, significantly increasing the risk of unauthorized actions.
        - **Compliance alignment**: Many security standards and frameworks require role-based access control for container orchestration platforms.
        - **Azure AD integration**: RBAC enables integration with Azure Active Directory for centralized identity management and authentication.

        By enabling RBAC, organizations can enforce proper access controls and minimize the risk of unauthorized access to Kubernetes resources.

        This check ensures that non-private AKS clusters have API server authorized IP ranges configured to restrict access to the Kubernetes API server from known, trusted networks. Private clusters are excluded from this check as they use private endpoints for API server access, which provides stronger network isolation.

        **Why this matters**

        Configuring authorized IP ranges for the AKS API server provides several critical benefits:

        - **Reduced attack surface**: Restricting API server access to known IP ranges prevents unauthorized networks from reaching the Kubernetes control plane.
        - **Defense in depth**: Even if API credentials are compromised, attackers cannot access the API server from unauthorized networks.
        - **Compliance alignment**: Many security frameworks require network-level access controls for management interfaces.
        - **Brute force prevention**: Limits the ability of attackers to perform brute force authentication attempts against the API server.

        By configuring authorized IP ranges, organizations can significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access to their Kubernetes management plane.

        This check ensures that AKS clusters have a network policy configured (such as Azure Network Policy or Calico) to control traffic flow between pods.

        **Why this matters**

        Configuring network policies on AKS clusters provides several critical benefits:

        - **Pod-to-pod traffic control**: Network policies allow you to define rules that control which pods can communicate with each other, implementing micro-segmentation.
        - **Lateral movement prevention**: Without network policies, all pods can communicate freely, allowing an attacker who compromises one pod to easily move to others.
        - **Compliance alignment**: Many security frameworks require network segmentation and traffic control for container workloads.
        - **Blast radius reduction**: Network policies limit the impact of a compromised pod by restricting its ability to reach other services in the cluster.

        By configuring network policies, organizations can enforce the principle of least privilege at the network level and reduce the risk of lateral movement within their Kubernetes clusters.

        **Why this matters**

        Disabling FTP basic auth provides several critical benefits:

        - **Credential security**: FTP basic authentication transmits credentials in an insecure manner and relies on static username/password combinations that can be easily compromised.
        - **Reduced attack surface**: Disabling basic auth forces the use of more secure deployment methods such as Azure AD-based authentication, deployment tokens, or managed identities.
        - **Brute force prevention**: Basic auth credentials are a common target for brute force attacks. Disabling them eliminates this attack vector.
        - **Compliance alignment**: Many security frameworks discourage or prohibit the use of basic authentication for publishing and deployment operations.

        By disabling FTP basic auth, organizations can enforce the use of stronger, more auditable authentication methods for application deployment.

        This check ensures that basic authentication for SCM (Kudu) site publishing is disabled on Azure App Service web apps, preventing the use of username/password credentials for deployment via the SCM endpoint.

        **Why this matters**

        Disabling SCM basic auth provides several critical benefits:

        - **Credential security**: SCM basic authentication uses static credentials that can be compromised through credential stuffing, phishing, or leaks.
        - **Reduced attack surface**: The SCM/Kudu endpoint provides powerful deployment and diagnostic capabilities; securing it with Azure AD authentication is critical.
        - **Deployment security**: Disabling basic auth forces the use of Azure AD-based authentication, which supports MFA, conditional access, and centralized audit logging.
        - **Compliance alignment**: Many security frameworks require strong authentication for all management and deployment interfaces.

        By disabling SCM basic auth, organizations can enforce stronger authentication for the powerful Kudu deployment endpoint.

        This check ensures that the non-SSL port (6379) is disabled on Azure Cache for Redis instances, requiring all connections to use TLS-encrypted communication.

        **Why this matters**

        Disabling the non-SSL port provides several critical benefits:

        - **Data protection**: Redis commands and data transmitted over unencrypted connections can be intercepted by attackers, exposing sensitive cached data.
        - **Authentication security**: Redis authentication tokens sent over unencrypted connections are vulnerable to interception.
        - **Compliance alignment**: Many security standards require encryption of data in transit, especially for caching services that may contain sensitive data.
        - **Industry best practice**: Microsoft recommends disabling the non-SSL port and using only TLS-encrypted connections for production Redis deployments.

        By disabling the non-SSL port, organizations ensure that all Redis communication is encrypted, protecting cached data from interception and unauthorized access.

        This check ensures that public network access is disabled on Azure Cache for Redis instances, requiring connections to go through private endpoints.

        **Why this matters**

        Disabling public network access provides several critical benefits:

        - **Reduced attack surface**: Disabling public access ensures that the Redis cache is not reachable from the public internet, eliminating a major attack vector.
        - **Network isolation**: All access must go through private endpoints within the virtual network, providing strong network-level isolation.
        - **Data protection**: Private endpoints ensure that Redis traffic stays within the Azure backbone network, reducing the risk of data interception.
        - **Compliance alignment**: Many security frameworks require that caching services containing sensitive data are not accessible from the public internet.

        By disabling public network access, organizations can ensure that their Redis caches are only accessible from trusted, internal networks.
