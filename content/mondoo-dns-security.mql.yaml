        The Mondoo DNS Security policy includes checks for assessing the configuration of DNS records.

        ## Remote scan

        Remote scans use cnspec providers to retrieve on-demand scan results without having to install any agents.

        ### Scan a host

        ```bash
        cnspec scan host <hostname>
        ```

        This check ensures that the root domain (often called the apex domain) does not have a CNAME (Canonical Name) record in its DNS settings.

        **Why this matters**

        Using CNAME records at the root domain is prohibited because it can lead to conflicts with other important DNS records, such as SOA (Start of Authority) and NS (Name Server) records.

        By avoiding CNAME records at the root domain, the system ensures:
          - Reliable DNS resolution, preventing service interruptions
          - Compliance with DNS standards and provider rules
          - Proper functionality of essential domain-related services, such as email or subdomains

        Without these protections, implementing a CNAME at the root domain could result in DNS resolution issues, service unavailability, and non-compliance with DNS provider policies.
      remediation: |
        1. Replace the CNAME record at the root domain with an A or ALIAS record (if supported by your DNS provider) to point to the appropriate IP address or hostname.
        2. Ensure the A or ALIAS record is correctly configured to maintain DNS compatibility and avoid resolution failures.
        3. Verify the updated DNS configuration using DNS validation tools to confirm proper resolution and functionality.

        This check ensures that DNS Name Server (NS) and Mail Exchange (MX) records do not point directly to IP addresses.

        **Why this matters**

        NS and MX records should point to fully qualified domain names (FQDNs) rather than IP addresses. Using IP addresses in these records can lead to several issues:

        - **Lack of flexibility**: Pointing to an IP address directly ties your DNS or mail configuration to a specific server, making it difficult to manage changes such as server migrations or load balancing.
        - **Potential downtime**: If the server IP address changes and DNS records are not updated promptly, services dependent on these records (e.g., email or domain resolution) can experience downtime.
        - **Non-compliance with DNS standards**: DNS resolvers expect NS and MX records to point to hostnames. Using IPs can lead to unpredictable behavior or DNS resolution failures.
        - **Security risks**: Directly exposing IP addresses can make your infrastructure more vulnerable to attacks, such as DDoS or reconnaissance efforts.

        By ensuring NS and MX records point to FQDNs, the system enhances flexibility, reduces downtime risks, and aligns with DNS standards, contributing to a more secure and reliable DNS configuration.
      remediation: |
        For NS records:
          1. Identify the authoritative DNS servers for your domain.
          2. Update the NS records in your DNS settings to point to the fully qualified domain names (FQDNs) of these servers (e.g., ns1.example.com).
          3. Remove any NS records pointing to IP addresses to ensure compliance with DNS standards.
          4. Verify the configuration using DNS validation tools to confirm proper resolution.

        For MX records:
          1. Identify the correct mail server FQDNs for your email provider (e.g., mail.example.com).
          2. Update the MX records in your DNS settings to point to these FQDNs, ensuring the correct priority values are set.
          3. Remove any MX records pointing to IP addresses or outdated servers to avoid misrouting or security risks.
          4. Test the configuration by sending and receiving emails to confirm proper functionality.

        This check ensures that legacy MX records, often associated with outdated email hosting configurations, are not used in domains configured for Microsoft 365 email services.

        **Why this matters**

        Legacy MX records can lead to several issues, including:

        - **Email delivery problems**: Outdated MX records may route email to obsolete or incorrect mail servers, causing delivery failures or delays.
        - **Security vulnerabilities**: Misconfigured MX records can expose email traffic to spoofing, phishing, or interception attacks if routed through untrusted servers.
        - **Incompatibility with Microsoft 365**: Microsoft 365 requires specific MX record configurations (e.g., *.mail.protection.outlook.com) to ensure proper email routing and security features like spam filtering and encryption.
        - **Increased administrative complexity**: Retaining legacy MX records adds unnecessary complexity, increasing the risk of mismanagement during troubleshooting or migrations.

        By removing legacy MX records, the system ensures:
          - Reliable email delivery through Microsoft 365
          - Enhanced security by preventing exposure to outdated or untrusted mail servers
          - Compliance with Microsoft 365 requirements and best practices

        Without these protections, legacy MX records could undermine email reliability and security, exposing the organization to unnecessary risks.
      remediation: |
        Replace all legacy MX records with the correct Microsoft 365 MX records provided in the Microsoft 365 Admin Center.

        Steps to remediate:
          1. Log in to your DNS hosting provider's control panel.
          2. Locate the DNS settings for your domain.
          3. Add or update the MX records to match the provided Microsoft 365 configuration, ensuring the correct priorities are set.
          4. Remove any legacy or non-Microsoft MX records to avoid misrouting or security vulnerabilities.
          5. Save the changes and verify the configuration using DNS checking tools websites.

          - Full functionality of Google Workspace features, including spam protection, encryption, and account-based email management
          - Compliance with Google Workspace's DNS configuration guidelines, minimizing the risk of service disruptions

        Without these protections, misconfigured MX records could lead to undelivered emails, security vulnerabilities, and reduced functionality of Google Workspace services.
      remediation: |
        To ensure proper email routing and security, configure the domain's MX records to point to Google's designated email servers:

          - ASPMX.L.GOOGLE.COM (Priority: 1)
          - ALT1.ASPMX.L.GOOGLE.COM (Priority: 5)
          - ALT2.ASPMX.L.GOOGLE.COM (Priority: 5)
          - ALT3.ASPMX.L.GOOGLE.COM (Priority: 10)
          - ALT4.ASPMX.L.GOOGLE.COM (Priority: 10)

        Steps to remediate:
          1. Log in to your DNS hosting provider's control panel.
          2. Locate the DNS settings for your domain.
          3. Add or update the MX records to match the above configuration, ensuring the correct priorities are set.

        This check ensures that DNSSEC (Domain Name System Security Extensions) is enabled for your domain to enhance security and protect against DNS-related attacks.

        **Why this matters**

        DNSSEC is a critical security feature that provides authentication for DNS responses. It protects against common threats such as DNS spoofing, cache poisoning, and man-in-the-middle attacks.

        By enabling DNSSEC, the system achieves:
          - Prevention of DNS spoofing by ensuring DNS responses are authentic and unaltered
          - Protection of data integrity through digital signatures on DNS records
          - Enhanced trust by ensuring users reliably connect to legitimate services
          - Compliance with security frameworks and best practices that recommend or require DNSSEC implementation

        Without these protections, DNSSEC misconfigurations or lack of implementation could expose the domain to security vulnerabilities, undermining the reliability and security of DNS operations.
      remediation: |
        * Enable DNSSEC for your domain by accessing your DNS hosting provider or domain registrar's control panel and following their specific instructions for enabling DNSSEC.
        * Regularly monitor DNSSEC configurations to ensure that DNSSEC signatures remain valid and do not expire. Set up alerts or reminders for signature expiration dates.
        * Use DNSSEC testing tools or online validators to verify proper configuration and functionality. Address any issues or warnings promptly to maintain DNSSEC integrity.
        * Educate your team on the importance of DNSSEC and establish a process for periodic reviews to ensure ongoing compliance and security.

    title: Ensure no wildcard DNS records are configured
    impact: 85
    mql: dns.records.none(name == /\*/)
    docs:
      desc: |
        This check ensures that no wildcard DNS records (e.g., *.example.com) are configured for your domain to enhance security and maintain control over DNS resolution.

        **Why this matters**

        Wildcard DNS records allow all subdomains, including those not explicitly defined, to resolve to a specified IP address or hostname. While this can be convenient, it introduces significant security risks and operational challenges.

        By avoiding wildcard DNS records, the system achieves:
          - Reduced attack surface by preventing the creation of arbitrary subdomains that could be exploited for malicious purposes
          - Enhanced security by mitigating risks such as phishing, malware distribution, and impersonation attacks
          - Improved control over DNS resolution, ensuring traffic is routed only to explicitly defined subdomains
          - Compliance with security best practices that discourage the use of wildcard DNS records

        Without these protections, wildcard DNS records could expose the domain to abuse, compromise security, and lead to unexpected or insecure behavior.
      remediation: |
        * Avoid using wildcard DNS records (*.example.com) unless absolutely necessary for a specific and well-documented use case.
        * Replace wildcard records with explicit DNS records for each required subdomain to maintain precise control over DNS resolution.
        * If wildcard records are required, ensure they are monitored and secured to prevent misuse or exploitation.
