        The Mondoo GitHub Repository Best Practices policy validates that GitHub repositories follow operational best practices that help maintain code quality, improve collaboration, and reduce operational risk. Missing documentation, disabled issue tracking, or improper repository configurations can lead to confusion, lost contributions, and difficulty maintaining projects over time.

        This policy checks repository settings including README presence, license files, code of conduct, contributing guidelines, and support documentation.

        ## Authenticating with GitHub

        This policy requires a GitHub personal access token to authenticate with GitHub's API. The personal access token is required regardless of whether you are scanning a public or a private repository. Access to private repositories is determined by the level of access the token cnspec is configured with when it runs.

        ### Create a personal access token

        To create a read-only personal access token, see [Creating a personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) on GitHub's documentation site.

        ### Configure a GITHUB_TOKEN environment variable

        You supply your personal access token to cnspec using the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable.

        #### Linux / macOS

        ```bash
        export GITHUB_TOKEN=<your personal access token>
        ```

        #### Windows

        ```powershell
        $Env:GITHUB_TOKEN = "<personal-access-token>"
        ```

        ## Scanning GitHub repositories

        To scan the configuration of a GitHub repository:

        ```bash
        cnspec scan github repo <ORG_NAME/REPO_NAME>
        ```

        Our goal is to build policies that are simple to deploy, accurate, and actionable.

        GitHub repositories should include a SUPPORT.md file to let people know how to get help with the project.

        To direct people to specific support resources, you can add a SUPPORT.md file to your repository's root, docs, or .github directory. When someone creates an issue in your repository, they will see a link to your project's SUPPORT.md file.

    docs:

        Check tries to determine if the project has published a license. It works by checking standard locations for a file named according to common license conventions.

        A license can give users information about how the source code may or may not be used. The lack of a license will impede any kind of security review or audit and creates a legal risk for potential users.

            2. Click on the "Add file" button.
            3. Select "Create new file".

            5. Add the content of the license you want to use.
            6. Commit the changes to your repository.

            The license should be chosen based on the project's goals and the intended audience. For example, if the project is intended for commercial use, a permissive license such as MIT or Apache 2.0 may be appropriate. If the project is intended for open source use, a copyleft license such as GPL may be appropriate.
