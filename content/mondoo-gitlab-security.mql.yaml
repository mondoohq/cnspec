        The Mondoo GitLab Security policy identifies misconfigurations that could expose your GitLab groups and projects to supply chain attacks, unauthorized code changes, and data breaches. Improperly secured GitLab environments can allow attackers to access private repositories, inject malicious code, or exfiltrate sensitive data.

        This policy validates critical security controls including group and project visibility settings, two-factor authentication requirements, and access control configurations.

        ### Prerequisites

        Remote scans of GitLab require a [personal access token](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/personal_access_tokens.html) with access to the group and projects you plan to scan.

        ### Scan a GitLab group and projects

        Open a terminal and configure an environment variable with your GitLab personal access token:

        ```bash
        export GITLAB_TOKEN=<your personal access token>
        ```

        Run a remote scan of your GitLab group:

        ```bash
        cnspec scan gitlab --group <group_name>
        ```

        ### Scan a single GitLab project

        Open a terminal and configure an environment variable with your GitLab personal access token:

        ```bash
        export GITLAB_TOKEN=<your personal access token>
        ```

        Scan a GitLab group:

        ```bash
        cnspec scan gitlab --group <group_name> --project <project_name>
        ```

    mql: gitlab.group.visibility != "public"
    docs:
      desc: |
        This check verifies that the GitLab group visibility is set to private or internal, not public.

        **Why this matters**

        Public GitLab groups expose all contained projects and their contents to anyone on the internet:

          - **Source code exposure**: Public groups allow anyone to clone repositories and view proprietary source code.
          - **Secret leakage**: Hardcoded credentials, API keys, or configuration files may be exposed in public repositories.
          - **Supply chain attacks**: Public visibility enables attackers to analyze code for vulnerabilities before they're patched.
          - **Intellectual property theft**: Competitors or malicious actors can access and copy proprietary algorithms and business logic.
          - **Reconnaissance**: Public groups provide attackers with information about your technology stack and infrastructure.

        Set group visibility to private unless there is an explicit business requirement for public access, and regularly audit group visibility settings.

            **Using GitLab UI**

            To make the visibility of a GitLab group private:

            1. In GitLab, navigate to your group.
            2. Go to **Settings** > **General**.
            3. Expand the **Visibility, project features, permissions** section.
            4. Under **Visibility level**, select **Private**.
            5. Click **Save changes**.

            **Using Terraform**

            To make the visibility of a GitLab group private using Terraform, you can use the following configuration:

            ```hcl
            resource "gitlab_group" "example" {
              name        = "example"
              path        = "example"
              visibility  = "private"
            }
            ```

  - uid: mondoo-gitlab-security-require-two-factor
    title: Ensure two-factor authentication is required
    mql: gitlab.group.requireTwoFactorAuthentication == true
    docs:
      desc: |
        This check verifies that two-factor authentication is required for all members of the GitLab group.

        **Why this matters**

        GitLab accounts are high-value targets for attackers seeking to compromise software supply chains:

          - **Source code tampering**: Compromised accounts can push malicious code that gets deployed to production.
          - **Credential theft protection**: Even if passwords are phished or leaked, attackers cannot access accounts without the second factor.
          - **CI/CD pipeline access**: Attackers with GitLab access can modify pipelines to inject malicious build steps.
          - **Secrets and variables**: GitLab projects often contain CI/CD variables with deployment credentials and API keys.
          - **Supply chain attacks**: Software supply chain compromises often begin with compromised developer accounts.

        Require 2FA at the group level to ensure all members are protected, and set a reasonable grace period for compliance.

            **Using GitLab UI**

            To require two-factor authentication for all users in a GitLab group:

            1. In GitLab, navigate to your group.
            2. Go to **Settings** > **General**.
            3. Expand the **Permissions and group features** section.
            4. Under **Require two-factor authentication**, check the box.
            5. Click **Save changes**.

    title: Ensure all projects are private
    mql: gitlab.group.projects.none(visibility == "public")
    docs:
      desc: |
        This check verifies that no projects within the GitLab group have public visibility.

        **Why this matters**

        Even when a group is private, individual projects can be set to public, exposing their contents:

          - **Inconsistent security**: Public projects in an otherwise private group create gaps in access control.
          - **Accidental exposure**: Developers may inadvertently set projects to public without understanding the implications.
          - **Data leakage**: Public projects expose code, issues, merge requests, and wiki content to the internet.
          - **Configuration drift**: Over time, project visibility settings may deviate from intended security posture.
          - **Compliance violations**: Regulatory requirements may prohibit public exposure of certain types of code or data.

        Enforce private visibility as the default for new projects and regularly audit all projects for visibility settings.

    mql: gitlab.project.visibility != "public"
    docs:
      desc: |
        This check verifies that the individual GitLab project visibility is set to private or internal, not public.

        **Why this matters**

        Public project visibility exposes the entire repository contents and metadata to anyone on the internet:

          - **Complete code exposure**: All source code, including historical commits, is accessible to anyone.
          - **Issue and MR visibility**: Bug reports, security issues, and code review discussions are publicly readable.
          - **CI/CD job logs**: Build and deployment logs may contain sensitive information or credentials.
          - **Dependency information**: Lock files and manifests reveal your technology stack and potential vulnerabilities.
          - **Contributor information**: Git history exposes developer names, emails, and work patterns.

        Set project visibility to private unless there is a documented business requirement for public access.
