        2. Navigate to the [Google API Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/dashboard).
        3. Select "Enable APIs and Services" and enable the following APIs:
          - Admin SDK API
          - Cloud Identity API
          - Google Calendar API
          - Google Drive API
          - Gmail API
          - Google People API
        4. Create a service account for [Google Workspace](https://support.google.com/a/answer/7378726?product_name=UnuFlow&hl=en&visit_id=638041387835615758-4147680582&rd=1&src=supportwidget0&hl=en)
        5. Create credentials for the service account and download the json file
        6. Enter the following scopes in Security -> Access and data controls -> API controls, and select [Domain-wide Delegation](https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/create-credentials#delegate_domain-wide_authority_to_your_service_account)

        ### Run policy

        To run this policy against a Google Workspace customer:

        ```bash
        export GOOGLEWORKSPACE_CREDENTIALS=$PWD/my-project-123456-1234ea722b12.json
        cnspec scan google-workspace --customer-id <CUSTOMERID> --impersonated-user-email <EMAIL>
        ```

            To enable 2-Step Verification (2FA) for Google Workspace users:

            1. Sign in to the [Google Admin console](https://admin.google.com/) using your administrator account.
            2. From the Admin console Home page, go to **Security** > **Authentication** > **2-step verification**.
            3. Click **Allow users to turn on 2-step verification** and select **On**.
            4. (Recommended) To enforce 2-step verification, under **Enforcement**, select **Turn on enforcement now** or **Turn on enforcement from** and choose a date.
            5. Click **Save**.
            6. Inform your users to set up 2-step verification the next time they sign in.

            For more details, see [Enforce 2-Step Verification](https://support.google.com/a/answer/175197?hl=en).

    title: Ensure fewer than four users have super admin permissions
    impact: 60
    mql: googleworkspace.report.users.where(security["isSuperAdmin"] == true).length <= 4
    docs:
      desc: |
        For larger organizations, it's useful to have several administrators to share the workload. Having more than 4 super admins, however, creates unnecessary risk.
      remediation: |
        Adjust the number of users who have admin privileges to be between 2 and 4. To learn how, read [Admin roles for businesses](https://support.google.com/a/topic/9832445?hl=en&ref_topic=2785005) in the Google Workspace documentation.
  - uid: mondoo-googleworkspace-security-minimum-super-admins

    docs:
      desc: |
        Having more than one administrator account is especially important to avoid single points of failure.
      remediation: |
        Adjust the number of users who have admin privileges to be between 2 and 4. To learn how, read [Admin roles for businesses](https://support.google.com/a/topic/9832445?hl=en&ref_topic=2785005) in the Google Workspace documentation.

    title: Users should not be allowed less secure app access
    impact: 70
    mql: googleworkspace.report.users.all(security["isLessSecureAppsAccessAllowed"] == false)
    docs:
      desc: |
        Less secure apps do not use modern security standards like OAuth, which increases the risk of compromised accounts and devices. By locking down these apps and devices, you increase data safety.
      remediation: |
        Make sure to block the usage of less secure apps in Google Workspace. To learn how, read [Control access to less secure apps](https://support.google.com/a/answer/6260879?hl=en) in the Google Workspace documentation.
  - uid: mondoo-googleworkspace-security-super-admins-should-use-hardware-based-2fa
    title: Super users should use hardware-based security keys
    impact: 70
    mql: googleworkspace.report.users.where(security["isSuperAdmin"] == true).all(security["numSecurityKeys"] >= 1)
    docs:
      desc: |
        All user accounts should be protected with two-factor authentication. This enhances protection against account takeovers by attackers. Furthermore high-value accounts such as Super Admins should be protected by hardware-based security keys as their second factor. They should not rely on SMS verification, which is prone to SIM swapping attacks.
      remediation: |
        Make sure that all high-value targets such as Super Admins have some form of two-factor authentication enabled. Also make sure that they are using security keys for the 2-Step verification process. To learn about setting up security keys for the 2-Step verification process, read [Use a security key for 2-Step Verification](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6103523?hl=En).
