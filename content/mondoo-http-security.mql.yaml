        The Mondoo HTTP Security policy identifies missing or misconfigured HTTP security headers that could expose web applications to cross-site scripting (XSS), clickjacking, MIME-type sniffing attacks, and information disclosure. Properly configured security headers provide defense-in-depth protection against common web-based attacks.

        This policy validates critical HTTP security headers including Content-Security-Policy, X-Content-Type-Options, Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS), and ensures sensitive server information is not exposed.

        ## Scan a host

        Remotely scan a host's HTTP configuration without installing an agent:

        ```bash
        cnspec scan host <fqdn>
        ```

    mql: http.get.header.xContentTypeOptions == "nosniff"
    docs:
      desc: |
        This check ensures that the 'X-Content-Type-Options' HTTP header is set to 'nosniff'.

        **Why this matters**

        The 'X-Content-Type-Options' header prevents browsers from MIME type sniffing a response away from the declared content type. This is important for security because:

        - **Prevents content-type confusion**: MIME sniffing can lead to browsers interpreting files as a different type than intended, potentially exposing vulnerabilities.
        - **Mitigates XSS attacks**: Attackers may exploit MIME sniffing to execute malicious scripts by tricking the browser into treating a file as executable content.
        - **Improves content integrity**: Ensures that files are processed as intended by the server, reducing the risk of unexpected behavior.

        By setting the 'X-Content-Type-Options' header to 'nosniff', the system enforces strict content type handling, enhancing security and reducing the attack surface.

            **Using NGINX**

            1. Open your NGINX configuration file (typically found at `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf` or in a site-specific file under `/etc/nginx/sites-available/`).
            2. Inside the `server` or `location` block, add the following line:

                ```nginx
                add_header X-Content-Type-Options "nosniff";
                ```

            3. Save the file and reload NGINX:

                ```bash
                nginx -s reload
                ```
        - id: apache

            **Using Apache HTTPD**

            1. Open your Apache configuration file or `.htaccess` file.
            2. Add the following directive:

                ```apache
                Header set X-Content-Type-Options "nosniff"
                ```

            3. Make sure the headers module is enabled:

                ```bash
                a2enmod headers
                systemctl restart apache2

            3. Click on `Add` in the right pane.
            4. Set the name to `X-Content-Type-Options` and the value to `nosniff`.
            5. Click OK and restart IIS:

    docs:
      desc: |
        This check ensures that the Content Security Policy (CSP) HTTP header is set to mitigate against Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and data injection attacks.

        **Why this matters**

        The Content Security Policy (CSP) header is a powerful tool to enhance the security of web applications by controlling the sources from which content can be loaded. This is important for several reasons:

        - **Mitigates XSS attacks**: CSP helps prevent attackers from injecting malicious scripts into web pages by restricting the sources of executable scripts.
        - **Prevents data injection**: By defining allowed content sources, CSP reduces the risk of unauthorized data being loaded into the application.
        - **Improves content integrity**: Ensures that only trusted resources are loaded, reducing the risk of compromised third-party content affecting the application.
        - **Enhances security posture**: Implementing CSP demonstrates a proactive approach to securing web applications against common vulnerabilities.

        By setting the CSP header, the system enforces strict content loading policies, reducing the attack surface and improving overall application security.

    docs:

        This check ensures that the Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS) HTTP header is set to enforce secure connections.

        **Why this matters**

        The Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS) header is a critical security feature that ensures all communication between the client and server is conducted over HTTPS. This is important for several reasons:

        - **Eliminates HTTP to HTTPS redirects**: HSTS removes the need for HTTP to HTTPS redirects, reducing latency and improving performance.
        - **Protects against man-in-the-middle attacks**: By enforcing HTTPS, HSTS prevents attackers from intercepting or tampering with data during transmission.
        - **Mitigates protocol downgrade attacks**: HSTS ensures that browsers do not fall back to insecure HTTP connections, even if an attacker attempts to force a downgrade.
        - **Improves user trust**: Enforcing HTTPS demonstrates a commitment to security, enhancing user confidence in the application.

        By setting the HSTS header, the system enforces secure connections, reduces the attack surface, and strengthens the overall security posture.

            **Using NGINX**

            1. Open your NGINX configuration file (typically found at `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf` or in a site-specific file under `/etc/nginx/sites-available/`).
            2. Inside the `http` block, add the following line:

                ```nginx
                proxy_hide_header X-AspNetMvc-Version;
                ```

            3. Save the file and reload NGINX:

                ```bash
                nginx -s reload
                ```

            **Using Apache HTTPD**

            1. Open your Apache configuration file or `.htaccess` file.
            2. Add the following directive:

                ```apache
                Header unset X-AspNetMvc-Version
                ```

            3. Make sure the headers module is enabled:

                ```bash
                a2enmod headers
                systemctl restart apache2
                ```
        - id: iis
          desc: |
            **Using IIS**

            1. Open the IIS Manager.
            2. Select your site and go to the `HTTP Response Headers` feature.
            3. Remove the `X-AspNetMvc-Version` header if it exists.
            4. Restart IIS:

                ```bash
                iisreset
                ```

    title: The header Public-Key-Pins is deprecated and should not be used
    mql: http.get.header.params.keys.none("Public-Key-Pins")
    docs:
      desc: |
        This check ensures that the Public-Key-Pins (HPKP) header is not used, as it is deprecated.

        **Why this matters**

        The Public-Key-Pins (HPKP) header was originally designed to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks by allowing websites to specify which public keys should be trusted for their certificates. However, it has been deprecated due to several issues:

        - **Risk of misconfiguration**: Incorrectly pinning keys can lead to websites becoming inaccessible if the pinned key is lost or compromised.
        - **Ease of abuse**: Attackers could maliciously pin keys to lock out legitimate site owners from their domains.
        - **Better alternatives available**: Modern mechanisms like Certificate Transparency and the use of the Expect-CT header provide safer and more effective ways to achieve similar goals.

        By avoiding the use of the HPKP header, the system reduces the risk of misconfiguration, mitigates potential abuse, and aligns with current best practices for secure web communication.

            **Using NGINX**

            1. Open your NGINX configuration file (typically found at `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf` or in a site-specific file under `/etc/nginx/sites-available/`).
            2. Inside the `http` block, add the following line to remove the header from proxied responses:

                ```nginx
                proxy_hide_header Public-Key-Pins;
                ```

            3. Also remove any existing `add_header Public-Key-Pins` directives from your configuration.

            4. Save the file and reload NGINX:

                ```bash
                nginx -s reload
                ```
