        The Mondoo HTTP Security policy identifies missing or misconfigured HTTP security headers that could expose web applications to cross-site scripting (XSS), clickjacking, MIME-type sniffing attacks, and information disclosure. Properly configured security headers provide defense-in-depth protection against common web-based attacks.

        This policy validates critical HTTP security headers including Content-Security-Policy, X-Content-Type-Options, Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS), and ensures sensitive server information is not exposed.

        ## Scan a host

        Remotely scan a host's HTTP configuration without installing an agent:

        ```bash
        cnspec scan host <fqdn>
        ```

    mql: http.get.header.xContentTypeOptions == "nosniff"
    docs:
      desc: |
        This check ensures that the 'X-Content-Type-Options' HTTP header is set to 'nosniff'.

        **Why this matters**

        The 'X-Content-Type-Options' header prevents browsers from MIME type sniffing a response away from the declared content type. This is important for security because:

        - **Prevents content-type confusion**: MIME sniffing can lead to browsers interpreting files as a different type than intended, potentially exposing vulnerabilities.
        - **Mitigates XSS attacks**: Attackers may exploit MIME sniffing to execute malicious scripts by tricking the browser into treating a file as executable content.
        - **Improves content integrity**: Ensures that files are processed as intended by the server, reducing the risk of unexpected behavior.

        By setting the 'X-Content-Type-Options' header to 'nosniff', the system enforces strict content type handling, enhancing security and reducing the attack surface.

            **Using NGINX**

            1. Open your NGINX configuration file (typically found at `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf` or in a site-specific file under `/etc/nginx/sites-available/`).
            2. Inside the `server` or `location` block, add the following line:

                ```nginx
                add_header X-Content-Type-Options "nosniff";
                ```

            3. Save the file and reload NGINX:

                ```bash
                nginx -s reload
                ```

    docs:
      desc: |
        This check ensures that the Content Security Policy (CSP) HTTP header is set to mitigate against Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and data injection attacks.

        **Why this matters**

        The Content Security Policy (CSP) header is a powerful tool to enhance the security of web applications by controlling the sources from which content can be loaded. This is important for several reasons:

        - **Mitigates XSS attacks**: CSP helps prevent attackers from injecting malicious scripts into web pages by restricting the sources of executable scripts.
        - **Prevents data injection**: By defining allowed content sources, CSP reduces the risk of unauthorized data being loaded into the application.
        - **Improves content integrity**: Ensures that only trusted resources are loaded, reducing the risk of compromised third-party content affecting the application.
        - **Enhances security posture**: Implementing CSP demonstrates a proactive approach to securing web applications against common vulnerabilities.

        By setting the CSP header, the system enforces strict content loading policies, reducing the attack surface and improving overall application security.

        This check ensures that the Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS) HTTP header is set to enforce secure connections.

        **Why this matters**

        The Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS) header is a critical security feature that ensures all communication between the client and server is conducted over HTTPS. This is important for several reasons:

        - **Eliminates HTTP to HTTPS redirects**: HSTS removes the need for HTTP to HTTPS redirects, reducing latency and improving performance.
        - **Protects against man-in-the-middle attacks**: By enforcing HTTPS, HSTS prevents attackers from intercepting or tampering with data during transmission.
        - **Mitigates protocol downgrade attacks**: HSTS ensures that browsers do not fall back to insecure HTTP connections, even if an attacker attempts to force a downgrade.
        - **Improves user trust**: Enforcing HTTPS demonstrates a commitment to security, enhancing user confidence in the application.

        By setting the HSTS header, the system enforces secure connections, reduces the attack surface, and strengthens the overall security posture.

        - **Facilitates reconnaissance**: Attackers can use this information to tailor their attacks, increasing the likelihood of success.
        - **Non-compliance with security best practices**: Security guidelines recommend minimizing information disclosure to reduce risks.

        By removing the X-AspNetMvc-Version header, the system reduces the attack surface, mitigates reconnaissance efforts, and aligns with security best practices.

    docs:
      desc: |
        This check ensures that the Public-Key-Pins (HPKP) header is not used, as it is deprecated.

        **Why this matters**

        The Public-Key-Pins (HPKP) header was originally designed to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks by allowing websites to specify which public keys should be trusted for their certificates. However, it has been deprecated due to several issues:

        - **Risk of misconfiguration**: Incorrectly pinning keys can lead to websites becoming inaccessible if the pinned key is lost or compromised.
        - **Ease of abuse**: Attackers could maliciously pin keys to lock out legitimate site owners from their domains.
        - **Better alternatives available**: Modern mechanisms like Certificate Transparency and the use of the Expect-CT header provide safer and more effective ways to achieve similar goals.

        By avoiding the use of the HPKP header, the system reduces the risk of misconfiguration, mitigates potential abuse, and aligns with current best practices for secure web communication.

        This check ensures that the X-Frame-Options HTTP header is set to prevent clickjacking attacks.

        **Why this matters**

        The X-Frame-Options header controls whether a browser should render a page inside a `<frame>`, `<iframe>`, `<embed>`, or `<object>` element. Without this header, attackers can embed your site in a malicious page to trick users into interacting with it unknowingly:

        - **Clickjacking attacks**: Attackers overlay invisible frames on legitimate pages, tricking users into clicking hidden elements that perform unintended actions such as changing account settings or initiating transactions.
        - **UI redressing**: Malicious sites can position transparent iframes over buttons or links, redirecting user interactions to attacker-controlled content.
        - **Session hijacking**: Combined with other vulnerabilities, clickjacking can be used to steal session tokens or credentials.

        Valid values are `DENY` (prevents all framing), `SAMEORIGIN` (allows framing only from the same origin), or `ALLOW-FROM uri` (allows framing from a specific URI).

        This check ensures that the Referrer-Policy HTTP header is set to control how much referrer information is sent with requests.

        **Why this matters**

        Without a Referrer-Policy header, browsers use their default policy, which may leak sensitive information in the Referer header:

        - **URL information disclosure**: The full URL, including query parameters that may contain tokens, session IDs, or other sensitive data, can be sent to third-party sites.
        - **Privacy concerns**: Referrer information reveals browsing patterns and internal URL structures to external sites.
        - **Data leakage via embedded resources**: Third-party scripts, images, and stylesheets loaded by the page receive the referrer, potentially exposing sensitive URL paths.

        Recommended values include `strict-origin-when-cross-origin` (sends only the origin for cross-origin requests), `no-referrer` (never sends referrer), or `same-origin` (sends referrer only for same-origin requests).

    mql: http.get.header.sts.maxAge >= 365 * time.day
    docs:
      desc: |
        This check ensures that the Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS) header specifies a max-age of at least 365 days (31536000 seconds). A short max-age reduces the effectiveness of HSTS, as browsers will stop enforcing HTTPS-only connections sooner.

        **Why this matters**

        The max-age directive controls how long browsers remember to enforce HTTPS for the site:

        - **Short max-age values**: With a short max-age, the HSTS protection expires quickly, leaving a window where an attacker could perform an SSL stripping attack after the cache expires.
        - **Browser preload requirement**: To be eligible for browser HSTS preload lists, a max-age of at least 31536000 seconds (1 year) is required.
        - **First-visit vulnerability**: After the HSTS cache expires, the next visit is vulnerable to interception until the browser receives the HSTS header again over a secure connection.

        A max-age of at least 31536000 seconds (1 year) is recommended by OWASP and required for HSTS preload eligibility.

        **Why this matters**

        Without the `includeSubDomains` directive, HSTS only applies to the exact domain that sets the header:

        - **Subdomain attacks**: Attackers can target unprotected subdomains (e.g., `api.example.com`, `mail.example.com`) with SSL stripping or man-in-the-middle attacks.
        - **Cookie scope exploitation**: Cookies set for the parent domain can be intercepted via unprotected subdomains, leading to session hijacking.
        - **Preload requirement**: The `includeSubDomains` directive is required for HSTS preload list eligibility.

        Including subdomains ensures comprehensive HSTS protection across the entire domain hierarchy.

    docs:

        This check ensures that the Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS) header includes the `preload` directive. HSTS preload allows the domain to be hardcoded into browsers' built-in HSTS lists, providing protection from the very first connection.

        **Why this matters**

        Standard HSTS has a fundamental limitation: the browser must visit the site at least once over HTTPS to receive the HSTS header. This creates a trust-on-first-use (TOFU) vulnerability:

        - **First-visit attack window**: The initial connection to a site is unprotected, allowing an attacker to intercept or downgrade the connection before the HSTS header is received.
        - **Cache expiration**: When the HSTS max-age expires, the next visit is again vulnerable until the header is refreshed.
        - **Browser preload lists**: With the `preload` directive (along with `includeSubDomains` and a sufficient `max-age`), the domain can be submitted to browser preload lists, eliminating the first-visit vulnerability entirely.

        Note: Submitting to preload lists is a separate step that must be done at https://hstspreload.org/ after setting the header.
