        The Mondoo macOS Security policy identifies misconfigurations that could leave macOS systems vulnerable to unauthorized access, malware infections, and data exfiltration. Improperly configured macOS systems can expose sensitive data through file sharing services, allow unauthorized remote access, or leave systems susceptible to network-based attacks.

        This policy validates critical security controls including FileVault encryption, firewall settings, Gatekeeper, sharing services, remote access configurations, and network security settings. It was tested against Apple macOS 10.15, 11, 12, 13, and 14.

        ## Local scan

        Local scan refer to scans of files and operating systems where cnspec is installed.

        To scan the `localhost` against this policy:

        ```bash
        cnspec scan local
        ```

        ## Remote scan

        Remotely scan a macOS host without installing an agent.

        ### Prerequisites

        Remote scans of macOS hosts requires **Remote login** to be enabled in the System Preferences, along with a suitable authentication method such as SSH keys.

        ### Scan a remote macOS (SSH authentication)

        ```bash
        cnspec scan ssh <user>@<IP_ADDRESS> -i /path/to/ssh_key
        ```

        This check ensures that the audit system on macOS is properly configured to protect critical operational and security information. The audit logs and configuration files should be owned by the root user and the wheel group, with strict read-only permissions to prevent unauthorized access or tampering.

        **Why this matters**

        The macOS audit system records important security and operational events, which can be valuable for detecting anomalies, investigating incidents, and maintaining system integrity. However, these logs can also be a target for attackers seeking to obfuscate their actions or gain unauthorized access.

        By ensuring that the `/etc/security/audit_control` configuration file and the files in `/var/audit` are owned by root and the wheel group, with no access granted to other users, the risk of unauthorized access or tampering is minimized. This configuration supports a defense-in-depth strategy by safeguarding critical audit records.

        Properly securing audit logs contributes to:
          - Enhanced system integrity and trustworthiness
          - Improved incident response and forensic capabilities
          - Compliance with security best practices and standards

        Without these protections, audit logs may be vulnerable to unauthorized changes, undermining their reliability and the overall security posture of the system.

            sudo chmod 600 /etc/security/audit_control
            sudo chown -R root:wheel /var/audit/
            sudo chmod -R 600 /var/audit/
            ```

            **Note:**

            Before applying these changes, verify the current access controls and investigate any unexpected modifications to the audit logs. If unauthorized changes are detected and cannot be traced, consider reinstalling the system to ensure its integrity.

            **Impact:**

            Securing audit logs prevents unauthorized access and tampering, ensuring the reliability of audit records for security monitoring and forensic analysis. However, improper permissions may disrupt legitimate access for system processes, so changes should be tested in a controlled environment before deployment.

        This check ensures that Bluetooth Sharing is disabled on macOS systems. Bluetooth Sharing allows files to be exchanged with Bluetooth-enabled devices, which can pose a security risk if not properly managed.

        **Why this matters**

        Bluetooth Sharing enables file transfers between macOS devices and other Bluetooth-enabled devices. While this feature can be convenient, it also introduces potential vulnerabilities, such as unauthorized access to shared files or exploitation of Bluetooth-related security flaws.

        Disabling Bluetooth Sharing reduces the attack surface of the system by preventing unauthorized file exchanges and mitigating risks associated with Bluetooth-based exploits. This is particularly important in environments where sensitive data is handled or where devices are exposed to untrusted networks.

        By ensuring Bluetooth Sharing is disabled, organizations can enhance the security posture of macOS systems and align with best practices for minimizing unnecessary services and features that could be exploited by attackers.

        This check ensures that the Bonjour advertising service is disabled on macOS systems to reduce unnecessary network traffic and potential exposure.

        **Why this matters**

        Bonjour is an auto-discovery mechanism for TCP/IP devices that enumerates devices and services within a local subnet. While DNS on macOS is integrated with Bonjour and should not be turned off, the Bonjour advertising service can be disabled to minimize risks.

        Bonjour advertising allows macOS devices to broadcast their presence and services on a local network. While this can be useful in certain environments, it may also expose the system to unnecessary risks, such as unauthorized access or network enumeration by malicious actors.

        By disabling Bonjour advertising, organizations can:
          - Reduce the attack surface of the system
          - Limit the visibility of services to other devices on the network
          - Enhance security posture in environments handling sensitive data or exposed to untrusted networks

        Without these protections, Bonjour advertising may inadvertently expose the system to potential threats, undermining its overall security posture.

        This check ensures that Content Caching is disabled on macOS systems to prevent unnecessary resource usage and potential security risks associated with local content distribution.

        **Why this matters**

        Content Caching is a service introduced in macOS High Sierra (10.13) to reduce bandwidth usage by caching software updates and other Apple-provided content on local networks. While this feature can be beneficial in specific scenarios, it may introduce unnecessary complexity and resource usage in environments where such caching is not required.

        By disabling Content Caching, organizations can ensure that macOS devices do not act as local content distribution nodes unless explicitly required. This reduces the attack surface, minimizes resource overhead, and aligns with best practices for securing macOS systems.

        Properly managing Content Caching contributes to:
          - Reduced network complexity and resource usage
          - Prevention of unauthorized content distribution
          - Compliance with security best practices and organizational policies

        Without these protections, Content Caching may inadvertently expose sensitive data or consume unnecessary resources, undermining the overall security and efficiency of the system.

        This check ensures that SMB file sharing is disabled on macOS systems to reduce the attack surface and enhance security.

        **Why this matters**

        SMB (Server Message Block) is a protocol used for file sharing, commonly utilized by Windows and Linux systems to access shared files on a Mac. While SMB can be convenient, it stores passwords in a less secure manner compared to AFP, potentially exposing sensitive information.

        By disabling SMB file sharing, the system minimizes the risk of unauthorized access and mitigates potential vulnerabilities associated with the protocol. This aligns with best practices for reducing unnecessary services and features that could be exploited by attackers.

        Disabling SMB file sharing contributes to:
          - Enhanced system security by reducing the attack surface
          - Prevention of unauthorized access to shared files
          - Compliance with security best practices and organizational policies

        Without these protections, SMB file sharing could expose sensitive data and increase the risk of exploitation, undermining the overall security posture of the system.

        This check ensures that Internet Sharing is disabled on macOS systems to prevent unauthorized devices from accessing the network through the Mac. Internet Sharing allows the Mac to function as a router, sharing its internet connection with other devices, which can pose security risks.

        **Why this matters**

        Internet Sharing uses the open source `natd` process to share an internet connection with other computers and devices on a local network. While this feature can be convenient in certain scenarios, it introduces potential vulnerabilities by exposing the Mac and its connected networks to unauthorized access.

        By disabling Internet Sharing, organizations can:
          - Reduce the attack surface of the system
          - Prevent unauthorized devices from accessing the network
          - Enhance security posture in environments handling sensitive data or exposed to untrusted networks

        Without these protections, Internet Sharing may inadvertently expose the system and its networks to potential threats, undermining their overall security posture.

        The root account is a superuser account with unrestricted access to all files and system functions. While it can be useful for administrative tasks, enabling the root account introduces significant security risks, such as unauthorized access, privilege escalation, and potential misuse.

        By disabling the root account, organizations can:
          - Reduce the attack surface of the system
          - Prevent unauthorized access to sensitive system functions
          - Enhance security posture in environments handling sensitive data or exposed to untrusted networks

        Without these protections, an enabled root account may inadvertently expose the system to potential threats, undermining its overall security posture.

        This check ensures that FileVault is enabled on macOS systems to secure the system's data by encrypting its boot volume and requiring a password or recovery key to access it.

        **Why this matters**

        FileVault provides full-disk encryption to protect sensitive data on macOS systems. By encrypting the boot volume, FileVault ensures that unauthorized users cannot access the system's data, even if the physical device is compromised. This is particularly important for devices that are frequently used in untrusted environments or contain sensitive information.

        Enabling FileVault contributes to:
          - Enhanced data security and privacy
          - Protection against unauthorized access in case of device theft or loss
          - Compliance with security best practices and organizational policies

        Without FileVault, the system's data is vulnerable to unauthorized access, undermining its overall security posture.

            You will be prompted to provide a password for the user account and will receive a recovery key. Store the recovery key securely, as it will be required to unlock the disk if the password is forgotten.

            Note: To pass this check and make sure encryption cannot be turned off by the system, you need to [make sure that the Device Management Profile property `dontAllowFDEDisable` is set to 'true'.](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/devicemanagement/fdefilevaultoptions). To do so you can use an macOS configuration profile [similar to this one.](https://github.com/gregneagle/profiles/blob/master/cant_disable_filevault.mobileconfig)

            **Impact:**

            Enabling FileVault may impact system performance during encryption and decryption processes. However, the security benefits of full-disk encryption outweigh the potential performance impact, especially for devices handling sensitive data.

        This check ensures that AirDrop is disabled on macOS systems to prevent unauthorized file sharing and mitigate privacy concerns.

        **Why this matters**

        AirDrop is Apple's built-in ad hoc file exchange system that uses Bluetooth LE for discovery and TLS encryption for file transfers. While it offers secure and convenient file sharing, it also introduces potential privacy risks by exposing personal information and allowing file sharing with nearby devices.

        By disabling AirDrop, organizations can:
          - Reduce the attack surface of the system
          - Prevent unauthorized file sharing
          - Enhance privacy and security posture in environments handling sensitive data or exposed to untrusted networks

        Without these protections, AirDrop may inadvertently expose the system to potential threats, undermining its overall security posture.

        The socketfilter firewall is used when the firewall is enabled in the Security Preference Pane. Enabling logging ensures that all access attempts, both allowed and denied, are recorded. This information is critical for monitoring network activity, detecting potential threats, and troubleshooting connectivity issues.

        By enabling firewall logging, organizations can:
          - Gain visibility into network access attempts
          - Detect unauthorized or suspicious activity

        This check ensures that the HTTP server is disabled on macOS systems to prevent unauthorized access and misuse of the embedded Apache web server.

        **Why this matters**

        macOS includes an embedded Apache web server that can be easily enabled to share files or provide remote connectivity. While this feature can be useful in specific scenarios, enabling the HTTP server introduces potential vulnerabilities by exposing the system to unauthorized access or misuse. Apple has removed the graphical front-end for enabling this feature, but the underlying service remains accessible.

        By disabling the HTTP server, organizations can:

        This check ensures that passwords are set to expire after a maximum of 365 days on macOS systems to mitigate the risks associated with password reuse and prolonged exposure.

        **Why this matters**

        Over time, passwords can be compromised through phishing attacks, third-party breaches, or brute force attacks. Regularly expiring passwords reduces the risk of exposure and encourages users to create new, unique passwords. This check uses 365 days as the acceptable maximum value, though organizations may choose to be more or less restrictive based on their security policies.

        By enforcing password expiration, organizations can:
          - Reduce the risk of password reuse across multiple systems
          - Mitigate the impact of compromised credentials
          - Enhance overall security posture by ensuring periodic password updates

        Without these protections, attackers may exploit exposed or reused passwords, increasing the likelihood of unauthorized access and compromising the system's security.

        This check ensures that password history is enforced on macOS systems to prevent the reuse of previous passwords, enhancing security by requiring unique passwords for each change.

        **Why this matters**

        Over time, passwords can be compromised through phishing attacks, third-party breaches, or brute force attacks. Enforcing password history ensures that users cannot reuse recently used passwords, reducing the risk of predictable password patterns and enhancing overall security.

        By enforcing password history, organizations can:
          - Mitigate the risk of password reuse across multiple systems
          - Reduce the likelihood of attackers exploiting predictable password changes
          - Enhance security posture by ensuring unique passwords for each change

        Without these protections, users may reuse old passwords, increasing the risk of unauthorized access and compromising the system's security.

        This check ensures that the sudo timeout period is reduced to zero on macOS systems to minimize the risk of unauthorized access during the sudo grace period.

        **Why this matters**

        The sudo command allows users to execute commands with elevated privileges. By default, sudo retains the user's authentication for a grace period, during which no password is required for subsequent sudo commands. While this feature is convenient, it introduces potential security risks, as an attacker or unauthorized process could exploit the grace period to execute commands with elevated privileges.

        By reducing the sudo timeout period to zero, organizations can:
          - Minimize the window of opportunity for unauthorized access
          - Enhance security posture by requiring re-authentication for each sudo command
          - Prevent misuse of elevated privileges in environments handling sensitive data

        Without these protections, the sudo grace period may inadvertently expose the system to potential threats, undermining its overall security posture.

        This check ensures that the install logs are retained for at least 365 days on macOS systems to support system maintenance and security forensics.

        **Why this matters**

        macOS writes system-related event information to `/var/log/install.log` and uses a configurable retention policy for this file. The default logging settings limit the file size and maximum size for all logs, which may not enforce sufficient log retention. Without proper retention, critical log data may be lost, hindering the ability to investigate incidents or perform audits.

        By ensuring that install logs are retained for at least 365 days, organizations can:
          - Maintain sufficient historical data for troubleshooting and forensic analysis
          - Support compliance with security best practices and standards
          - Enhance system monitoring and accountability

        Without these protections, critical log data may be lost, reducing visibility into potential security incidents and undermining the overall security posture of the system.

        This check ensures that critical software updates are installed automatically on macOS systems to maintain system security and stability.

        **Why this matters**

        Automatic installation of critical updates ensures that macOS systems remain protected against known vulnerabilities and exploits. Critical updates often address security flaws, stability issues, and other high-priority concerns that could compromise the system if left unpatched.

        By enabling automatic installation of critical updates, organizations can:
          - Reduce the risk of exploitation of known vulnerabilities
          - Ensure timely application of essential patches
          - Enhance overall system security and compliance with best practices

        Without these protections, macOS systems may remain vulnerable to known threats, undermining their overall security posture.
