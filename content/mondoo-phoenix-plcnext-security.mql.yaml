        Installing the latest firmware is important for several reasons:

        - Security: Firmware updates often include security patches to address vulnerabilities in the system, making it less susceptible to hacking or other security threats.
        - Bug fixes: Updates often include fixes for bugs and other software issues, which can improve the performance and stability of the device.
        - New features: Updates may add new features or functionality to the device, making it more versatile and improving its overall performance.
        - Compatibility: Installing the latest firmware can ensure compatibility with other devices or systems, preventing conflicts or connectivity issues.
        - Performance: Firmware updates can improve the overall performance of the device, such as improving processing speed, battery life, or other key metrics.

        By installing the latest firmware, you can ensure that your device is secure, performs optimally, and is fully compatible with other systems. This can help reduce downtime, improve productivity, and extend the lifespan of your device.

        The hazards in public and even private networks are omnipresent, and nowadays no private user would come up with the idea to put a computer on the network without a proper firewall setting. So how would that be different when working with a PLC?

        PLCnext Technology  relies on the proven and commonly used Linux® firewall nftables. On the PLCnext Control, you don't need to configure the firewall rules via cryptic Linux shell commands: Just log on to the Web-based Management and choose from the predefined basic rules, or add your own rules to the set.

        In addition to the PLCnext Technology filter table, you can activate other filter tables. This might be necessary if you require certain functions that are not supported by the firewall configuration via the WBM.

        This additional configuration is implemented via independent filter tables. You have to create the required functions via nftables commands. For this, you can edit a rule set in Linux using a text editor or load the file to the PC and change it.

        For detailed information on this Linux feature, refer to the nftables documentation.

        Here you see a set of firewall filter files that is present in the /etc/nftables directory on a PLCnext Control

    docs:

        Using SSH key authentication is considered to be a more secure method of logging into a remote system than using passwords. Here are some reasons why you might want to consider using only SSH key authentication:

        - Increased security: SSH key authentication uses public-key cryptography to secure the connection, which is considered to be much more secure than using passwords. Passwords can be guessed or cracked, whereas an SSH key must be physically acquired by an attacker to be used to gain unauthorized access.

        - Convenience: Once you have set up an SSH key pair, logging into a remote system is faster and more convenient than typing a password every time.

        - Improved audit trail: SSH key authentication provides a more detailed audit trail, making it easier to detect and respond to unauthorized access attempts.

        - Automation: SSH key authentication can be automated, making it easier to automate tasks and access remote systems without human intervention.

        While there are benefits to using only SSH key authentication, it is important to ensure that your SSH keys are managed properly, with strong passwords, and are backed up in case of loss or corruption.

        In summary, allowing only SSH key authentication can provide a more secure and convenient way to access remote systems, but it is important to manage your keys properly to ensure that the increased security is not compromised.
