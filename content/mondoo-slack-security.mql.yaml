        The Mondoo Slack Team Security policy identifies misconfigurations in Slack workspaces that could expose sensitive communications and enable unauthorized access. Improperly configured Slack workspaces can lead to data leakage, unauthorized channel access, and compromised user accounts through phishing or credential theft.

        This policy validates critical security controls including two-factor authentication requirements, session settings, external sharing policies, and app installation permissions.

        ### Prerequisites

        To run this query pack, you need access to the Slack API. This requires creating a new app in the Slack workspace, so you can retrieve a token.

        1. Sign in to [the Slack website](https://api.slack.com/apps/) and view **Your Apps**.
        2. Select **Create New App**.
        3. Select **From scratch**.
        4. Enter an app name (such as `cnquery`), select the workspace, then select **Create App**.
        5. In the **Add features & functionality** section, select **Permissions**.
        6. Scroll to **Scopes** and select **User Token Scopes**.

          Note: Bots are very limited in their access so you must assign user scopes.

        7. Add the required permissions to **User Token Scopes**:

          | OAuth Scope  |
          | ---- |
          | [channels:read](https://api.slack.com/scopes/channels:read) |
          | [groups:read](https://api.slack.com/scopes/groups:read) |
          | [im:read](https://api.slack.com/scopes/im:read) |
          | [mpim:read](https://api.slack.com/scopes/mpim:read) |
          | [team:read](https://api.slack.com/scopes/team:read) |
          | [usergroups:read](https://api.slack.com/scopes/usergroups:read) |
          | [users:read](https://api.slack.com/scopes/users:read) |

        8. Scroll up to **OAuth Tokens for Your Workspace** and select **Install to Workspace**.
        9. Copy the provided **User OAuth Token**. It looks like this: `xoxp-1234567890123-1234567890123-1234567890123-12345cea5ae0d3bed30dca43cb34c2d1`

        ### Run cnspec using this policy

        To run this policy against a Slack workspace:

        ```bash
        export SLACK_TOKEN=xoxp-TOKEN
        cnspec scan slack --policy-bundle mondoo-slack-security.mql.yaml
        ```

        Alternatively, you can use the CLI flag to connect to your Slack workspace:

        ```bash
        cnspec scan slack --token TOKEN --policy-bundle mondoo-slack-security.mql.yaml
        ```

        ## Note:
        You need to set the two properties in this policy to some values that make sense for your organizations.
        Modify the blocks below as needed:

        ```mql
          - uid: mondooSlackSecurityExternalChannelName
            title: Enter your naming pattern for externally shared Slack channels
            mql: |
              return /ext|extern|ex_/
          - uid: mondooSlackSecurityAllowListedDomains
            title: Enter allowed domains here
            mql: |
              return /mondoo.com|example.com/
        ```

    docs:

        This check verifies that your Slack workspace has between 2 and 4 administrator accounts, balancing operational resilience with security risk reduction.

        **Why this matters**

        The number of administrator accounts directly impacts both operational capability and security exposure:

          - **Single point of failure**: Having only one admin creates operational risk if that person is unavailable or leaves the organization.
          - **Expanded attack surface**: Each admin account is a high-value target; more admins means more potential compromise vectors.
          - **Privilege creep**: Organizations often accumulate admins over time without removing former ones, unnecessarily expanding risk.
          - **Audit complexity**: Too many admins makes it difficult to track who made security-sensitive changes.
          - **Shared responsibility**: Multiple admins enable load sharing while keeping the privileged group small and accountable.

        Maintain 2-4 administrators who actively need the privileges, and regularly review whether each admin account is still necessary.
      remediation: |
        Adjust the number of users who have admin privileges to be between 2 and 4. To learn how, read [Change a member's role](https://slack.com/help/articles/218124397-Change-a-members-role) in the Slack documentation.

    docs:

        This check verifies that all Slack administrator accounts use app-based two-factor authentication (TOTP) rather than SMS-based verification.

        **Why this matters**

        Administrator accounts have full control over workspace security and require the strongest authentication protection:

          - **SIM swapping attacks**: SMS codes can be intercepted by attackers who convince carriers to transfer phone numbers.
          - **SS7 vulnerabilities**: The cellular signaling network has known weaknesses that allow SMS interception.
          - **Social engineering**: Carrier support staff can be tricked into redirecting SMS messages to attackers.
          - **Elevated privileges**: Compromised admin accounts can disable security controls, export data, and add malicious users.
          - **Regulatory requirements**: Many compliance frameworks recommend or require phishing-resistant authentication for privileged accounts.

        Require all administrators to use authenticator apps (like Google Authenticator, Authy, or 1Password) instead of SMS for 2FA.
      remediation: |
        Make sure that all admin accounts use authentication applications for two-factor authentication rather than SMS. To learn about setting up two-factor authentication to use an application, read [Set up two-factor authentication](https://slack.com/help/articles/204509068-Set-up-two-factor-authentication) in the Slack documentation.

        This check verifies that all active Slack users have two-factor authentication enabled on their accounts.

        **Why this matters**

        Two-factor authentication provides critical protection against credential-based attacks across all user accounts:

          - **Credential stuffing**: Passwords leaked from other services can be used to access Slack if 2FA is not enabled.
          - **Phishing protection**: Even if users enter credentials on a fake login page, attackers cannot complete authentication without the second factor.
          - **Lateral movement**: Compromised user accounts can be used to access sensitive channels and impersonate employees.
          - **Data exfiltration**: Attackers with account access can search and export confidential conversations and files.
          - **Compliance requirements**: SOC 2, ISO 27001, and other frameworks require or recommend multi-factor authentication.

        Enable 2FA requirements at the workspace or organization level to ensure all users are protected, not just those who opt in.
      remediation: |
        Make sure that all users have some form of two-factor authentication enabled. To learn about setting up two-factor authentication, read [Set up two-factor authentication](https://slack.com/help/articles/204509068-Set-up-two-factor-authentication) in the Slack documentation.

        This check verifies that externally shared Slack channels follow a consistent naming pattern (such as "ext-" or "external-") that clearly identifies them.

        **Why this matters**

        Clear visual distinction between internal and external channels prevents accidental information disclosure:

          - **Context awareness**: Users immediately know when they're communicating with external parties based on channel name.
          - **Sensitive information leakage**: Without clear naming, employees may share confidential information in channels they believe are internal.
          - **Audit and compliance**: Consistent naming makes it easy to identify and review all external communication channels.
          - **Access control reviews**: Security teams can quickly locate external channels during periodic access reviews.
          - **Policy enforcement**: Naming conventions support automated monitoring and alerting for external channel activity.

        Establish and enforce a naming convention (like prefixing with "ext-" or "external-") for all channels shared with parties outside your organization.
      remediation: |
        Make sure to use a fixed pattern for all externally shared channels. To learn more, read [Create guidelines for channel names](https://slack.com/help/articles/217626408-Create-guidelines-for-channel-names) in the Slack documentation.

        This check verifies that your Slack workspace has at least one channel that is exclusively internal and not shared with external users, organizations, or other workspaces.

        **Why this matters**

        Internal-only channels are essential for confidential organizational communication:

          - **Confidential discussions**: Sensitive topics like personnel matters, strategy, or security incidents require channels without external access.
          - **Shadow IT indicator**: A workspace with no internal channels may indicate improper workspace configuration or misuse.
          - **Compliance boundaries**: Certain communications must remain within organizational boundaries for regulatory compliance.
          - **Incident response**: Security incidents should be coordinated in channels that external parties cannot access.
          - **Onboarding and HR**: Employee-only topics require channels guaranteed to exclude contractors or external partners.

        Ensure at least one channel exists for purely internal communication, and clearly communicate its purpose to employees.

        This check verifies that internal-only channels do not contain external members such as guest users, strangers, or single-channel guests.

        **Why this matters**

        Internal channels can be compromised by the presence of users who should not have access to internal communications:

          - **Guest user access**: Guest accounts may inadvertently be added to channels meant for employees only.
          - **Stranger presence**: Users from connected organizations may appear in channels through Slack Connect features.
          - **Single-channel guests**: Limited-access guests might be present in channels beyond their intended scope.
          - **Information leakage**: External members in "internal" channels can access confidential discussions and files.
          - **False sense of security**: Employees may share sensitive information believing the channel is internal-only.

        Regularly audit internal channel membership to ensure only authorized employees are present, and remove any external users immediately.
      remediation: |
        Create at least one channel which is for internal workspace use only. Make sure that no user who does not belong to your organization is in the channel(s).

        This check verifies that all members of internal (non-externally-shared) channels have email addresses from your organization's allowed domains.

        **Why this matters**

        Domain-based access control ensures that only authorized users can access internal communications:

          - **Unauthorized access**: Users with email addresses from unauthorized domains may have been added incorrectly or maliciously.
          - **Former employee access**: Personal email accounts or previous employer domains indicate users who shouldn't have access.
          - **Third-party infiltration**: Vendor or partner users in internal channels can access information beyond their engagement scope.
          - **Data governance**: Regulatory requirements often mandate that certain data only be accessible to employees with corporate identities.
          - **Offboarding gaps**: Domain allowlisting helps identify users who should have been removed when they left the organization.

        Configure your allowed domains list to match your organization's email domains, and regularly review internal channel membership.
      remediation: |
        Review all internal channels for members with email domains not on your allowlist. Remove unauthorized users and investigate how they gained access.
