        The Mondoo Slack Team Security policy ensures that Slack team configurations follow best security practices.

        ### Prerequisites

        To run this query pack, you need access to the Slack API. This requires creating a new app in the Slack workspace, so you can retrieve a token.

        1. Sign in to [the Slack website](https://api.slack.com/apps/) and view **Your Apps**.
        2. Select **Create New App**.
        3. Select **From scratch**.
        4. Enter an app name (such as `cnquery`), select the workspace, then select **Create App**.
        5. In the **Add features & functionality** section, select **Permissions**.
        6. Scroll to **Scopes** and select **User Token Scopes**.

          Note: Bots are very limited in their access so you must assign user scopes.

        7. Add the required permissions to **User Token Scopes**:

          | OAuth Scope  |
          | ---- |
          | [channels:read](https://api.slack.com/scopes/channels:read) |
          | [groups:read](https://api.slack.com/scopes/groups:read) |
          | [im:read](https://api.slack.com/scopes/im:read) |
          | [mpim:read](https://api.slack.com/scopes/mpim:read) |
          | [team:read](https://api.slack.com/scopes/team:read) |
          | [usergroups:read](https://api.slack.com/scopes/usergroups:read) |
          | [users:read](https://api.slack.com/scopes/users:read) |

        8. Scroll up to **OAuth Tokens for Your Workspace** and select **Install to Workspace**.
        9. Copy the provided **User OAuth Token**. It looks like this: `xoxp-1234567890123-1234567890123-1234567890123-12345cea5ae0d3bed30dca43cb34c2d1`

        ### Run cnspec using this policy

        To run this policy against a Slack workspace:

        ```bash
        export SLACK_TOKEN=xoxp-TOKEN
        cnspec scan slack --policy-bundle mondoo-slack-security.mql.yaml
        ```

        Alternatively, you can use the CLI flag to connect to your Slack workspace:

        ```bash
        cnspec scan slack --token TOKEN --policy-bundle mondoo-slack-security.mql.yaml
        ```

        ## Note:
        You need to set the two properties in this policy to some values that make sense for your organizations.
        Modify the blocks below as needed:

        ```mql
          - uid: mondooSlackSecurityExternalChannelName
            title: Enter your naming pattern for externally shared Slack channels
            mql: |
              return /ext|extern|ex_/
          - uid: mondooSlackSecurityAllowListedDomains
            title: Enter allowed domains here
            mql: |
              return /mondoo.com|example.com/
        ```

    docs:

        Having more than one administrator account is especially important to avoid single points of failure. For larger organizations, it's also useful to have several administrators to share the workload. More than 4 admins, however, creates unnecessary risk.
      remediation: |
        Adjust the number of users who have admin privileges to be between 2 and 4. To learn how, read [Change a member's role](https://slack.com/help/articles/218124397-Change-a-members-role) in the Slack documentation.

    docs:
      desc: |
        Administrator accounts should use more secure two-factor authentication, using an authentication application like Authy. They should not rely on SMS verification, which is prone to SIM swapping attacks.
      remediation: |
        Make sure that all admin accounts use authentication applications for two-factor authentication rather than SMS. To learn about setting up two-factor authentication to use an application, read [Set up two-factor authentication](https://slack.com/help/articles/204509068-Set-up-two-factor-authentication) in the Slack documentation.

    docs:
      desc: |
        All user accounts should be protected with two-factor authentication. This enhances protection against account takeovers by attackers.
      remediation: |
        Make sure that all users have some form of two-factor authentication enabled. To learn about setting up two-factor authentication, read [Set up two-factor authentication](https://slack.com/help/articles/204509068-Set-up-two-factor-authentication) in the Slack documentation.

        A clear naming pattern for all channels shared with external users or organizations makes it easier to spot faulty channels, and can prevent the involuntary disclosure of internal information.
      remediation: |
        Make sure to use a fixed pattern for all externally shared channels. To learn more, read [Create guidelines for channel names](https://slack.com/help/articles/217626408-Create-guidelines-for-channel-names) in the Slack documentation.

      remediation: |
        Create at least one channel that is for internal workspace use only.

        There should be at least one internal channel per workspace that isn't shared with (or about to be shared with) external users or other workspaces or organizations.
        This checks if there are members in the channels that do no belong, such as guest users, strangers, and single-channel-guest-users.
      remediation: |
        Create at least one channel which is for internal workspace use only. Make sure that no user who does not belong to your organization is in the channel(s).
