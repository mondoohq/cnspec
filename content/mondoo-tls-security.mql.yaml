    docs:
      desc: |
        The domain name in an SSL/TLS certificate must match the hostname it is intended to secure. Mismatched certificates indicate potential misconfigurations or malicious activity. This can lead to user trust issues and browser warnings, causing service interruptions or loss of user confidence.
      remediation: |
        Ensure the certificate's Common Name (CN) or Subject Alternative Name (SAN) fields match the intended domain name. Obtain a valid certificate for the domain from a trusted Certificate Authority (CA) and install it on the server.

    mql: |
      tls.certificates.last.isCA
    docs:
      desc: |
        Self-signed certificates are not trusted by default in browsers or operating systems. They lack authentication from a trusted CA, exposing the service to MITM attacks and reducing user trust.
      remediation: |
        Replace self-signed certificates with ones issued by a trusted CA. Configure the server to use the new certificates.
  - uid: mondoo-tls-security-cert-not-revoked

        signingAlgorithm != /md2|md5|sha1/i
      }
    docs:
      desc: |
        Weak certificate signatures (e.g., SHA-1) are vulnerable to cryptographic attacks. Using them undermines the encryption and allows attackers to forge certificates.
      remediation: |
        Use certificates signed with strong algorithms such as SHA-256 or stronger. Obtain updated certificates from a trusted CA.
  - uid: mondoo-tls-security-no-weak-tls-versions
    title: Avoid weak SSL and TLS versions
    impact: 95
    mql: |
      tls.versions.containsOnly(["tls1.2", "tls1.3"])
    docs:
      desc: |
        Weak SSL/TLS versions (e.g., SSL 3.0, TLS 1.0) are vulnerable to numerous exploits like POODLE. Their continued use compromises encrypted communication security.
      remediation: |
        Disable SSL and older versions of TLS (e.g., 1.0, 1.1). Enable TLS 1.2 or 1.3 on the server. Update server configurations to enforce modern protocols.
  - uid: mondoo-tls-security-no-rc4-ciphers
    title: Avoid RC4 ciphers
    impact: 90
    mql: |
      tls.ciphers.none( /rc4/i )
    docs:
      desc: |
        RC4 is a weak cipher prone to cryptographic attacks. Its use is discouraged as it does not provide sufficient encryption strength for modern applications.
      remediation: |
        Remove RC4 from the server's list of supported ciphers. Configure preferred ciphers to use modern, secure options such as AES-GCM.
  - uid: mondoo-tls-security-no-null-cipher-suites
    title: Avoid NULL cipher suites
    impact: 100
    mql: |
      tls.ciphers.none( /null/i )
    docs:
      desc: |
        NULL cipher suites do not encrypt data during transmission, exposing the data to interception and unauthorized access. Their use undermines the purpose of secure communication.
      remediation: |
        Disable NULL cipher suites in your server configuration. Ensure that only secure cipher suites are enabled, such as those using AES-GCM or ChaCha20.
  - uid: mondoo-tls-security-no-export-cipher-suites
    title: Avoid export ciphers suites
    impact: 95
    mql: |
      tls.ciphers.none( /export/i )
    docs:
      desc: |
        Export cipher suites are intentionally weakened cryptographic algorithms designed to meet outdated export regulations. They are vulnerable to brute-force attacks and compromise encryption security.
      remediation: |
        Remove export cipher suites from your server configuration. Replace them with strong, modern cipher suites such as AES-GCM or ChaCha20.
  - uid: mondoo-tls-security-no-diffie-hellman-cipher-suites
    title: Avoid anonymous Diffie-Hellman suites
    impact: 95
    mql: |
      tls.ciphers.none( /dh_anon/i )
    docs:
      desc: |
        Anonymous Diffie-Hellman suites lack authentication, allowing attackers to impersonate the server or client. This can lead to man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks and data compromise.
      remediation: |
        Disable anonymous Diffie-Hellman suites in your server configuration. Use authenticated key exchange methods such as ECDHE with certificate authentication.
  - uid: mondoo-tls-security-no-weak-block-ciphers
    title: Avoid weak block ciphers
    impact: 85
    mql: tls.ciphers.none( /des|rc2|idea/i )
    docs:
      desc: |
        Weak block ciphers, such as DES or 3DES, are vulnerable to modern cryptographic attacks, including brute force and collision attacks, reducing the overall security of the communication.
      remediation: |
        Disable weak block ciphers in your server configuration. Use strong encryption algorithms such as AES-256 or AES-GCM.
  - uid: mondoo-tls-security-no-weak-block-cipher-modes
    title: Avoid weak block cipher modes
    impact: 90
    mql: tls.ciphers.none( /cbc/i )
    docs:
      desc: |
        Weak block cipher modes, such as CBC without proper padding or initialization vector (IV) management, are susceptible to attacks like BEAST or padding oracle attacks.
      remediation: |
        Disable weak cipher modes like CBC where feasible, and prefer AEAD modes such as GCM or ChaCha20-Poly1305. Update your server configuration to enforce these modes.
  - uid: mondoo-tls-security-no-rsa-key-exchange
    title: Avoid cipher suites with RSA key exchange
    impact: 85
    mql: tls.ciphers.none( /^tls_rsa/i )
    docs:
      desc: |
        Cipher suites using RSA key exchange lack forward secrecy, making past communications vulnerable if the private key is compromised.
      remediation: |
        Disable RSA key exchange in your server configuration. Prefer cipher suites with forward secrecy, such as ECDHE or DHE key exchanges.
  - uid: mondoo-tls-security-no-old-cipher-suites
    title: Avoid old cipher suites
    impact: 90
    mql: tls.ciphers.none( /^old/i )
    docs:
      desc: |
        Old cipher suites, such as those using MD5 or SHA-1, are vulnerable to cryptographic attacks. Their use compromises the security of communications.
      remediation: |
        Remove outdated cipher suites from your server configuration. Ensure that only modern cipher suites like AES-GCM or ChaCha20-Poly1305 are enabled.
  - uid: mondoo-tls-security-ciphers-include-aead-ciphers
    title: Preferred ciphers must include AEAD ciphers
    impact: 85
    mql: tls.ciphers.any( /chacha20_poly1305|gcm|ccm/i )
    docs:
      desc: |
        AEAD (Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data) ciphers provide both confidentiality and integrity protection, making them a critical component of modern secure communication protocols.
      remediation: |
        Ensure the server configuration includes AEAD ciphers such as AES-GCM or ChaCha20-Poly1305. Remove any non-AEAD ciphers from the preferred list.
  - uid: mondoo-tls-security-ciphers-include-pfs
    title: Preferred ciphers must include perfect forward secrecy (PFS)
    impact: 95
    mql: tls.ciphers.any( /ecdhe_(rsa|ecdsa)|dhe_(rsa|dss)|cecpq/i )
    docs:
      desc: |
        PFS ensures that session keys cannot be derived from a compromised private key, protecting past communications even if future keys are exposed.
      remediation: |
        Configure the server to prioritize cipher suites with forward secrecy, such as ECDHE or DHE key exchanges. Remove non-PFS cipher suites.
