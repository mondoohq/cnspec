        The Mondoo Microsoft Windows Security policy identifies misconfigurations that could leave Windows systems vulnerable to unauthorized access, malware infections, and lateral movement attacks. Improperly configured Windows systems can enable attackers to exploit SMB vulnerabilities, bypass User Account Control (UAC), steal credentials, and establish persistent access.

        This policy validates critical security controls including password policies, Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) hardening, SMB security settings, UAC configurations, and network access restrictions. It was tested against Microsoft Windows 10 Release 20H2 Enterprise and later versions.

        ## Local scan

        Local scan refer to scans of files and operating systems where cnspec is installed.

        To scan the `localhost` against this policy:

        ```bash
        cnspec scan local
        ```

        ## Remote scan

        Remotely scan a Windows host without installing an agent.

        ### Prerequisites

        Remote scans of Windows hosts require an authentication method such as WinRM or SSH keys.

        ### Scan a remote Windows device (SSH authentication)

        ```bash
        cnspec scan ssh <user>@<IP_ADDRESS> -i /path/to/ssh_key
        ```

      secpol.privilegerights['SeDebugPrivilege'] == empty
    docs:
      desc: |
        This check ensures that the 'Debug programs' privilege is not assigned to any user or group. This privilege allows attaching a debugger to any process or the kernel, providing complete access to sensitive and critical operating system components.

        **Why this matters**

        The 'Debug programs' privilege is highly sensitive and should only be granted in exceptional cases:
          •  It allows unrestricted access to all processes, including those running as SYSTEM, which can lead to privilege escalation.
          •  Developers debugging their own applications do not require this privilege; it is only needed for debugging system-level components.
          •  Assigning this privilege unnecessarily increases the attack surface and violates the principle of least privilege.

        If this privilege is assigned, it can lead to:
          •  Unauthorized access to critical system processes and data.
          •  Privilege escalation attacks, where a compromised account can gain full control of the system.
          •  Non-compliance with security benchmarks such as CIS Windows Benchmarks and NIST 800-53.

        By ensuring that the 'Debug programs' privilege is not assigned, organizations can reduce the risk of privilege escalation, enhance system security, and maintain compliance with security best practices.

        This check ensures that additional LSA protection is enabled. This feature restricts access to the Local Security Authority (LSA) subsystem, safeguarding sensitive information such as passwords, user account details, and security tokens.

        **Why this matters**

        Enabling LSA protection is critical for maintaining system security:
          •  It prevents unauthorized processes from accessing or manipulating the LSA, reducing the risk of credential theft.
          •  It enforces access controls and code integrity checks, ensuring only trusted processes can interact with the LSA subsystem.
          •  It mitigates the risk of attacks that target sensitive system components.

        If LSA protection is not enabled, it can lead to:
          •  Unauthorized access to sensitive credentials and security tokens.
          •  Increased vulnerability to credential theft and privilege escalation attacks.
          •  Non-compliance with security benchmarks such as CIS Windows Benchmarks and NIST 800-53.

        By enabling LSA protection, organizations can enhance system security, reduce the attack surface, and protect against credential theft and other security threats.

        This check ensures that Remote Desktop Services always prompts the client computer for a password upon connection. This setting enforces a password prompt for users logging on to Remote Desktop Services, even if they have already provided the password in the Remote Desktop Connection client.

        **Why this matters**

        Enforcing a password prompt enhances security by:
          • Preventing unauthorized access to Remote Desktop Services sessions.
          • Ensuring that credentials are verified at the time of connection, reducing the risk of credential theft or misuse.
          • Aligning with security best practices and compliance requirements.

        If this setting is not enabled, it can lead to:
          • Increased risk of unauthorized access to sensitive systems.
          • Potential exploitation of saved credentials in the Remote Desktop Connection client.
          • Non-compliance with security benchmarks such as CIS Windows Benchmarks and NIST 800-53.

        By enabling this setting, organizations can strengthen access controls, reduce the attack surface, and maintain compliance with security standards.

            This Group Policy path is provided by the Group Policy template `TerminalServer.admx/adml` that is included with all versions of the Microsoft Windows Administrative Templates.

            **Note #2:**
            In the Microsoft Windows Vista Administrative Templates, this setting was named _Always prompt client for password upon connection_, but it was renamed starting with the Windows Server 2008 (non-R2) Administrative Templates.

            **Impact:**

            Users cannot automatically log on to Remote Desktop Services by supplying their passwords in the Remote Desktop Connection client. They will be prompted for a password to log on.

        Proper configuration of Event Log behavior is critical for maintaining system security and ensuring the availability of audit logs:
          •  When the log file reaches its maximum size, retaining old events or overwriting them can impact the ability to analyze historical data.
          •  Incorrect configuration may result in the loss of critical security events, hindering forensic investigations.
          •  Ensuring this setting is disabled aligns with security best practices and compliance requirements.

        If this setting is not configured correctly, it can lead to:
          •  Loss of important security events due to overwriting or improper retention.
          •  Non-compliance with security benchmarks such as CIS Windows Benchmarks and NIST 800-53.
          •  Reduced ability to detect and respond to security incidents effectively.

        By ensuring this policy is set to 'Disabled', organizations can maintain the integrity of their audit logs, enhance security monitoring, and comply with industry standards.

        This check ensures that the maximum size of the log file is configured to at least 32,768 kilobytes. This setting determines the maximum size of the log file in kilobytes, which can range from 1 megabyte (1,024 kilobytes) to 4 terabytes (4,194,240 kilobytes).

        **Why this matters**

        Proper configuration of log file size is critical for maintaining system security and ensuring the availability of audit logs:
          •  It prevents the loss of critical security events due to insufficient log space.
          •  It ensures that sufficient historical data is available for forensic investigations and compliance audits.
          •  It aligns with security best practices and compliance requirements.

        If the log file size is not configured appropriately, it can lead to:
          •  Loss of important security events due to log overwrites or truncation.
          •  Non-compliance with security benchmarks such as CIS Windows Benchmarks and NIST 800-53.

            **Impact:**

            When event logs fill to capacity, they will stop recording information unless the retention method for each is set so that the computer will overwrite the oldest entries with the most recent ones. To mitigate the risk of loss of recent data, you can configure the retention method so that older events are overwritten as needed.

            The consequence of this configuration is that older events will be removed from the logs. Attackers can take advantage of such a configuration, because they can generate a large number of extraneous events to overwrite any evidence of their attack. These risks can be somewhat reduced if you automate the archival and backup of event log data.

            Ideally, all specifically monitored events should be sent to a server that uses Microsoft System Center Operations Manager (SCOM) or some other automated monitoring tool. Such a configuration is particularly important because an attacker who successfully compromises a server could clear the Security log. If all events are sent to a monitoring server, then you will be able to gather forensic information about the attacker's activities.

      desc: |-
        This check ensures that local accounts are restricted from being used for remote administration via network logon. This setting applies UAC token-filtering to local accounts on network logons, disabling membership in powerful groups such as Administrators and removing powerful privileges from the resulting access token.

        **Why this matters**

        Allowing local accounts to have full administrative rights during network logons poses significant security risks:
          •  It increases the risk of credential theft, especially when the same account and password are configured on multiple systems.
          •  It enables attackers to use compromised local accounts to escalate privileges and gain unauthorized access to sensitive resources.
          •  It violates the principle of least privilege, exposing systems to potential exploitation.

        If this setting is disabled, it can lead to:
          •  Unauthorized access to administrative resources via local accounts.
          •  Increased vulnerability to Pass-the-Hash (PtH) attacks and other credential theft techniques.
          •  Non-compliance with security benchmarks such as CIS Windows Benchmarks and NIST 800-53.

        By enabling this setting, organizations can mitigate the risks associated with local account misuse, enhance system security, and maintain compliance with security best practices.

        This check ensures that account lockout events are audited. This setting tracks when a user's account is locked out due to multiple failed logon attempts, providing visibility into potential unauthorized access attempts.

        **Why this matters**

        Auditing account lockout events is essential for maintaining system security:
          •  It helps identify potential brute force attacks or unauthorized access attempts.
          •  It provides critical information for forensic investigations and incident response.
          •  It ensures compliance with security benchmarks such as CIS Windows Benchmarks and NIST 800-53.

        If account lockout events are not audited, it can lead to:
          •  Undetected unauthorized access attempts or brute force attacks.
          •  Limited visibility into account-related security incidents.
          •  Non-compliance with security best practices and regulatory requirements.

        By auditing account lockout events, organizations can enhance security monitoring, detect potential threats, and maintain compliance with industry standards.

        This check ensures that changes to application groups are audited, specifically looking for both success and failure events. Application groups are used by Windows Authorization Manager to implement role-based access control (RBAC) in applications.

        **Why this matters**

        Auditing both success and failure events for changes to application groups is essential for maintaining system security:
          •  It helps track the creation, modification, or deletion of application groups, ensuring accountability.
          •  It provides visibility into membership changes, such as adding or removing members from application groups.
          •  It ensures that failed attempts to modify application groups are also logged, which can help detect potential unauthorized access attempts.
          •  It supports compliance with security benchmarks and regulatory requirements.

        If changes to application groups are not audited for both success and failure events, it can lead to:
          •  Undetected unauthorized modifications to application groups.
          •  Reduced ability to investigate security incidents involving application group misuse.

        This policy setting allows administrators to enable the more precise auditing capabilities present in Windows Vista.

        The Audit Policy settings available in Windows Server 2003 Active Directory do not yet contain settings for managing the new auditing subcategories. To properly apply the auditing policies prescribed in this baseline, the Audit: Force audit policy subcategory settings (Windows Vista or later) to override audit policy category settings setting needs to be configured to Enabled.

        The recommended state for this setting is: `Enabled`.

        **Important:**
        Be very cautious about audit settings that can generate a large volume of traffic. For example, if you enable either success or failure auditing for all of the Privilege Use subcategories, the high volume of audit events generated can make it difficult to find other types of entries in the Security log. Such a configuration could also have a significant impact on system performance.

        This policy allows you to audit the group membership information in the user's logon token. Events in this subcategory are generated on the computer on which a logon session is created. For an interactive logon, the security audit event is generated on the computer that the user logged on to. For a network logon, such as accessing a shared folder on the network, the security audit event is generated on the computer hosting the resource.

        The recommended state for this setting is to include: `Success`.

        **Note:**
        A Windows 10, Server 2016 or newer OS is required to access and set this value in Group Policy.

            #### Using Group Policy

            To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to include `Success`:

            ```
            Computer Configuration\\Policies\\Windows Settings\\Security Settings\\Advanced Audit Policy Configuration\\Audit Policies\\Logon/Logoff\\Audit Group Membership
            ```

            **Impact:**

            If no audit settings are configured, or if audit settings are too lax on the computers in your organization, security incidents might not be detected or not enough evidence will be available for network forensic analysis after security incidents occur. However, if audit settings are too severe, critically important entries in the Security log may be obscured by all of the meaningless entries and computer performance and the available amount of data storage may be seriously affected. Companies that operate in certain regulated industries may have legal obligations to log certain events or activities.

        This subcategory reports on the activities of the Internet Protocol security (IPsec) driver. Events for this subcategory include:

        - 4960: IPsec dropped an inbound packet that failed an integrity check. If this problem persists, it could indicate a network issue or that packets are being modified in transit to this computer. Verify that the packets sent from the remote computer are the same as those received by this computer. This error might also indicate interoperability problems with other IPsec implementations.
        - 4961: IPsec dropped an inbound packet that failed a replay check. If this problem persists, it could indicate a replay attack against this computer.
        - 4962: IPsec dropped an inbound packet that failed a replay check. The inbound packet had too low a sequence number to ensure it was not a replay.
        - 4963: IPsec dropped an inbound clear text packet that should have been secured. This is usually due to the remote computer changing its IPsec policy without informing this computer. This could also be a spoofing attack attempt.
        - 4965: IPsec received a packet from a remote computer with an incorrect Security Parameter Index (SPI). This is usually caused by malfunctioning hardware that is corrupting packets. If these errors persist, verify that the packets sent from the remote computer are the same as those received by this computer. This error may also indicate interoperability problems with other IPsec implementations. In that case, if connectivity is not impeded, then these events can be ignored.
        - 5478: IPsec Services has started successfully.
        - 5479: IPsec Services has been shut down successfully. The shutdown of IPsec Services can put the computer at greater risk of network attack or expose the computer to potential security risks.
        - 5480: IPsec Services failed to get the complete list of network interfaces on the computer. This poses a potential security risk because some of the network interfaces may not get the protection provided by the applied IPsec filters. Use the IP Security Monitor snap-in to diagnose the problem.
        - 5483: IPsec Services failed to initialize RPC server. IPsec Services could not be started.
        - 5484: IPsec Services has experienced a critical failure and has been shut down. The shutdown of IPsec Services can put the computer at greater risk of network attack or expose the computer to potential security risks.
        - 5485: IPsec Services failed to process some IPsec filters on a plug-and-play event for network interfaces. This poses a potential security risk because some of the network interfaces may not get the protection provided by the applied IPsec filters. Use the IP Security Monitor snap-in to diagnose the problem.

            **Impact:**

            If no audit settings are configured, or if audit settings are too lax on the computers in your organization, security incidents might not be detected or not enough evidence will be available for network forensic analysis after security incidents occur. However, if audit settings are too severe, critically important entries in the Security log may be obscured by all of the meaningless entries and computer performance and the available amount of data storage may be seriously affected. Companies that operate in certain regulated industries may have legal obligations to log certain events or activities.

        This policy setting allows you to audit user attempts to access file system objects on a removable storage device. A security audit event is generated only for all objects for all types of access requested. If you configure this policy setting, an audit event is generated each time an account accesses a file system object on a removable storage. Success audits record successful attempts and Failure audits record unsuccessful attempts. If you do not configure this policy setting, no audit event is generated when an account accesses a file system object on a removable storage.

        The recommended state for this setting is: `Success and Failure`.

        **Note:**
        A Windows 8.0, Server 2012 (non-R2) or newer OS is required to access and set this value in Group Policy.

            **Impact:**

            If no audit settings are configured, or if audit settings are too lax on the computers in your organization, security incidents might not be detected or not enough evidence will be available for network forensic analysis after security incidents occur. However, if audit settings are too severe, critically important entries in the Security log may be obscured by all of the meaningless entries and computer performance and the available amount of data storage may be seriously affected. Companies that operate in certain regulated industries may have legal obligations to log certain events or activities.

        This policy setting determines whether the system shuts down if it is unable to log Security events. It is a requirement for Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria (TCSEC)-C2 and Common Criteria certification to prevent auditable events from occurring if the audit system is unable to log them. Microsoft has chosen to meet this requirement by halting the system and displaying a stop message if the auditing system experiences a failure. When this policy setting is enabled, the system will be shut down if a security audit cannot be logged for any reason.

        If the Audit: Shut down system immediately if unable to log security audits setting is enabled, unplanned system failures can occur. The administrative burden can be significant, especially if you also configure the Retention method for the Security log to Do not overwrite events (clear log manually). This configuration causes a repudiation threat (a backup operator could deny that they backed up or restored data) to become a denial of service (DoS) vulnerability, because a server could be forced to shut down if it is overwhelmed with logon events and other security events that are written to the Security log. Also, because the shutdown is not graceful, it is possible that irreparable damage to the operating system, applications, or data could result. Although the NTFS file system guarantees its integrity when an ungraceful computer shutdown occurs, it cannot guarantee that every data file for every application will still be in a usable form when the computer restarts.

            **Impact:**

            If no audit settings are configured, or if audit settings are too lax on the computers in your organization, security incidents might not be detected or not enough evidence will be available for network forensic analysis after security incidents occur. However, if audit settings are too severe, critically important entries in the Security log may be obscured by all of the meaningless entries and computer performance and the available amount of data storage may be seriously affected. Companies that operate in certain regulated industries may have legal obligations to log certain events or activities.

        This policy setting determines the number of renewed, unique passwords that have to be associated with a user account before you can reuse an old password. The value for this policy setting must be between 0 and 24 passwords. The default value for Windows Vista is 0 passwords, but the default setting in a domain is 24 passwords. To maintain the effectiveness of this policy setting, use the Minimum password age setting to prevent users from repeatedly changing their password.

        The recommended state for this setting is: `24 or more password(s)`.

        **Note:**
        Password Policy settings (section 1.1) and Account Lockout Policy settings (section 1.2) must be applied via the **Default Domain Policy**
        GPO in order to be globally in effect on **domain**
        user accounts as their default behavior. If these settings are configured in another GPO, they will only affect **local**
        user accounts on the computers that receive the GPO. However, custom exceptions to the default password policy and account lockout policy rules for specific domain users and/or groups can be defined using Password Settings Objects (PSOs), which are completely separate from Group Policy and most easily configured using Active Directory Administrative Center.

        **Note #2:**

            **Impact:**

            The major impact of this configuration is that users must create a new password every time they are required to change their old one. If users are required to change their passwords to new unique values, there is an increased risk of users who write their passwords somewhere so that they do not forget them. Another risk is that users may create passwords that change incrementally (for example, password01, password02, and so on) to facilitate memorization but make them easier to guess. Also, an excessively low value for the Minimum password age setting will likely increase administrative overhead, because users who forget their passwords might ask the help desk to reset them frequently.

        This policy setting defines how long a user can use their password before it expires.

        Values for this policy setting range from 0 to 999 days. If you set the value to 0, the password will never expire.

        Because attackers can crack passwords, the more frequently you change the password the less opportunity an attacker has to use a cracked password. However, the lower this value is set, the higher the potential for an increase in calls to help desk support due to users having to change their password or forgetting which password is current.

            If the Maximum password age setting is too low, users are required to change their passwords very often. Such a configuration can reduce security in the organization, because users might write their passwords in an insecure location or lose them. If the value for this policy setting is too high, the level of security within an organization is reduced because it allows potential attackers more time in which to discover user passwords or to use compromised accounts.

        This policy setting determines the least number of characters that make up a password for a user account. There are many different theories about how to determine the best password length for an organization, but perhaps "passphrase" is a better term than "password." In Microsoft Windows 2000 and newer, passphrases can be quite long and can include spaces. Therefore, a phrase such as "I want to drink a $5 milkshake" is a valid passphrase; it is a considerably stronger password than an 8 or 10 character string of random numbers and letters, and yet is easier to remember. Users must be educated about the proper selection and maintenance of passwords, especially with regard to password length. In enterprise environments, the ideal value for the Minimum password length setting is 14 characters, however you should adjust this value to meet your organization's business requirements.

        The recommended state for this setting is: `14 or more character(s)`.

        **Note:**
        In Windows Server 2016 and older versions of Windows Server, the GUI of the Local Security Policy (LSP), Local Group Policy Editor (LGPE) and Group Policy Management Editor (GPME) would not let you set this value higher than 14 characters. However, starting with Windows Server 2019, Microsoft changed the GUI to allow up to a 20 character minimum password length.

        Password Policy settings (section 1.1) and Account Lockout Policy settings (section 1.2) must be applied via the **Default Domain Policy**

            Requirements for extremely long passwords can actually decrease the security of an organization, because users might leave the information in an insecure location or lose it. If very long passwords are required, mistyped passwords could cause account lockouts and increase the volume of help desk calls. If your organization has issues with forgotten passwords due to password length requirements, consider teaching your users about passphrases, which are often easier to remember and, due to the larger number of character combinations, much harder to discover.

            **Note:**
            Older versions of Windows such as Windows 98 and Windows NT 4.0 do not support passwords that are longer than 14 characters. Computers that run these older operating systems are unable to authenticate with computers or domains that use accounts that require long passwords.

        This setting determines which method NetBIOS over TCP/IP (NetBT) uses to register and resolve names. The available methods are:

        - The B-node (broadcast) method only uses broadcasts.
        - The P-node (point-to-point) method only uses name queries to a name server (WINS).
        - The M-node (mixed) method broadcasts first, then queries a name server (WINS) if broadcast failed.
        - The H-node (hybrid) method queries a name server (WINS) first, then broadcasts if the query failed.

        The recommended state for this setting is: `Enabled: P-node (recommended)`
        (point-to-point).

        **Note:**
        Resolution through LMHOSTS or DNS follows these methods. If the `NodeType` registry value is present, it overrides any `DhcpNodeType`
        registry value. If neither `NodeType` nor `DhcpNodeType` is present, the computer uses B-node (broadcast) if there are no WINS servers
        configured for the network, or H-node (hybrid) if there is at least one WINS server configured.

            #### Using Group Policy

            To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to `Enabled: P-node (recommended)`:

            ```
            Computer Configuration\\Policies\\Administrative Templates\\MS Security Guide\\NetBT NodeType configuration
            ```

            **Note:**
            This change does not take effect until the computer has been restarted.

            **Note #2:**
            This Group Policy path does not exist by default. An additional Group Policy template ( `SecGuide.admx/adml` ) is required - it is available from Microsoft at [this link](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Microsoft-Security-Baselines/Security-baseline-FINAL-for-Windows-10-v1903-and-Windows-Server/ba-p/701084). Please note that this setting is **only**
            available in the _Security baseline (FINAL) for Windows 10 v1903 and Windows Server v1903_
            (or newer) release of `SecGuide.admx/adml`, so if you previously downloaded this template, you may need to update it from a newer Microsoft baseline to get this new _NetBT NodeType configuration_
            setting.

            **Impact:**

            NetBIOS name resolution queries will require a defined and available WINS server for external NetBIOS name resolution. If a WINS server is not defined or not reachable, and the desired hostname is not defined in the local cache, local LMHOSTS or HOSTS files, NetBIOS name resolution will fail.

        This setting determines if online identities are able to authenticate to this computer.

        The Public Key Cryptography Based User-to-User (PKU2U) protocol introduced in Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 is implemented as a security support provider (SSP). The SSP enables peer-to-peer authentication, particularly through the Windows 7 media and file sharing feature called HomeGroup, which permits sharing between computers that are not members of a domain.

        With PKU2U, a new extension was introduced to the Negotiate authentication package, `Spnego.dll`. In previous versions of Windows, Negotiate decided whether to use Kerberos or NTLM for authentication. The extension SSP for Negotiate, `Negoexts.dll`, which is treated as an authentication protocol by Windows, supports Microsoft SSPs including PKU2U.

        When computers are configured to accept authentication requests by using online IDs, `Negoexts.dll`
        calls the PKU2U SSP on the computer that is used to log on. The PKU2U SSP obtains a local certificate and exchanges the policy between the peer computers. When validated on the peer computer, the certificate within the metadata is sent to the logon peer for validation and associates the user's certificate to a security token and the logon process completes.

        LAN Manager (LM) was a family of early Microsoft client/server software (predating Windows NT) that allowed users to link personal computers together on a single network. LM network capabilities included transparent file and print sharing, user security features, and network administration tools. In Active Directory domains, the Kerberos protocol is the default authentication protocol. However, if the Kerberos protocol is not negotiated for some reason, Active Directory will use LM, NTLM, or NTLMv2. LAN Manager authentication includes the LM, NTLM, and NTLM version 2 (NTLMv2) variants, and is the protocol that is used to authenticate all Windows clients when they perform the following operations:

        - Join a domain
        - Authenticate between Active Directory forests
        - Authenticate to down-level domains
        - Authenticate to computers that do not run Windows 2000, Windows Server 2003, or Windows XP
        - Authenticate to computers that are not in the domain

        The Network security: LAN Manager authentication level setting determines which challenge/response authentication protocol is used for network logons. This choice affects the level of authentication protocol used by clients, the level of session security negotiated, and the level of authentication accepted by servers.

        The recommended state for this setting is: `Send NTLMv2 response only. Refuse LM & NTLM`.

            None - this is the default behavior. However, if you choose instead to configure the server to _require_LDAP signatures then you must also configure the client.
            If you do not configure the client it will not be able to communicate with the server, which could cause many features to fail, including user authentication,
            Group Policy, and logon scripts, because the caller will be told that the LDAP BIND command request failed.

      secpol.systemaccess['PasswordComplexity'] == 1
    docs:
      desc: |-
        This policy setting checks all new passwords to ensure that they meet basic requirements for strong passwords.

        When this policy is enabled, passwords must meet the following minimum requirements:

        - Not contain the user's account name or parts of the user's full name that exceed two consecutive characters
        - Be at least six characters in length
        - Contain characters from three of the following categories:
        - English uppercase characters (A through Z)
        - English lowercase characters (a through z)
        - Base 10 digits (0 through 9)
        - Non-alphabetic characters (for example, !, $, #, %)
        - A catch-all category of any Unicode character that does not fall under the previous four categories. This fifth category can be regionally specific.


        Each additional character in a password increases its complexity exponentially. For instance, a seven-character, all lower-case alphabetic password would have 267 (approximately 8 x 109 or 8 billion) possible combinations. At 1,000,000 attempts per second (a capability of many password-cracking utilities), it would only take 133 minutes to crack. A seven-character alphabetic password with case sensitivity has 527 combinations. A seven-character case-sensitive alphanumeric password without punctuation has 627 combinations. An eight-character password has 268 (or 2 x 1011) possible combinations. Although this might seem to be a large number, at 1,000,000 attempts per second it would take only 59 hours to try all possible passwords. Remember, these times will significantly increase for passwords that use ALT characters and other special keyboard characters such as "!" or "@". Proper use of the password settings can help make it difficult to mount a brute force attack.

        The recommended state for this setting is: `Enabled`.

        **Note:**
        Password Policy settings (section 1.1) and Account Lockout Policy settings (section 1.2) must be applied via the **Default Domain Policy**
        GPO in order to be globally in effect on **domain**
        user accounts as their default behavior. If these settings are configured in another GPO, they will only affect **local**
        user accounts on the computers that receive the GPO. However, custom exceptions to the default password policy and account lockout policy rules for specific domain users and/or groups can be defined using Password Settings Objects (PSOs), which are completely separate from Group Policy and most easily configured using Active Directory Administrative Center.

            **Impact:**

            If the default password complexity configuration is retained, additional help desk calls for locked-out accounts could occur because users might not be accustomed to passwords that contain non-alphabetic characters. However, all users should be able to comply with the complexity requirement with minimal difficulty.

            If your organization has more stringent security requirements, you can create a custom version of the Passfilt.dll file that allows the use of arbitrarily complex password strength rules. For example, a custom password filter might require the use of non-upper row characters. (Upper row characters are those that require you to hold down the SHIFT key and press any of the digits between 1 and 0.) A custom password filter might also perform a dictionary check to verify that the proposed password does not contain common dictionary words or fragments.

            Also, the use of ALT key character combinations can greatly enhance the complexity of a password. However, such stringent password requirements can result in unhappy users and an extremely busy help desk. Alternatively, your organization could consider a requirement for all administrator passwords to use ALT characters in the 0128 - 0159 range. (ALT characters outside of this range can represent standard alphanumeric characters that would not add additional complexity to the password.)

            **Note:**
            By default, this setting will use a self-signed certificate for RDP connections. If your organization has established the use of a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) for SSL/TLS encryption, then we recommend that you also configure the _Server authentication certificate template_setting to instruct RDP to use a certificate from your PKI instead of a self-signed one. Note that the certificate template used for this purpose must have “Client Authentication” configured as an Intended Purpose. Note also that a valid, non-expired certificate using the specified template must already be installed on the workstation for it to work.

            **Note #2:**
            Some third party two-factor authentication solutions (e.g. RSA Authentication Agent) can be negatively affected by this setting, as the SSL/TLS security layer will expect the user's Windows password upon initial connection attempt (before the RDP logon screen), and once successfully authenticated, pass the credential along to that Windows session on the RDP host (to complete the login). If a two-factor agent is present and expecting a different credential at the RDP logon screen, this initial connection may result in a failed logon attempt, and also effectively cause a “double logon” requirement for each and every new RDP session.

        **Why this matters**

        Enabling NLA for remote connections is critical for the following reasons:
          •  It ensures that users are authenticated before a remote desktop session is established, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.
          •  It protects the RD Session Host server from denial-of-service attacks by unauthenticated users.
          •  It aligns with security best practices and compliance requirements for secure remote access.

        If NLA is not enabled, it can lead to:
          •  Unauthorized access to the RD Session Host server.
          •  Increased exposure to brute-force attacks on the RDP login interface.
          •  Non-compliance with security benchmarks such as CIS Windows Benchmarks and NIST 800-53.

        By ensuring that NLA is enabled, organizations can enhance the security of remote desktop connections, mitigate the risk of unauthorized access, and maintain compliance with security best practices.

            Computer Configuration\\Policies\\Administrative Templates\\Windows Components\\Remote Desktop Services\\Remote Desktop Session Host\\Security\\Require user authentication for remote connections by using Network Level Authentication
            ```

            **Note:**
            This Group Policy path is provided by the Group Policy template `TerminalServer.admx/adml` that is included with all versions of the Microsoft Windows Administrative Templates.

            **Note #2:**
            In the Microsoft Windows Vista Administrative Templates, this setting was initially named _Require user authentication using RDP 6.0 for remote connections_, but it was renamed starting with the Windows Server 2008 (non-R2) Administrative Templates.

            **Impact:**

            Only client computers that support Network Level Authentication can connect to the RD Session Host server.

            **Note:**
            Some third party two-factor authentication solutions (e.g. RSA Authentication Agent) can be negatively affected by this setting, as Network Level Authentication will expect the user's Windows password upon initial connection attempt (before the RDP logon screen), and once successfully authenticated, pass the credential along to that Windows session on the RDP host (to complete the login). If a two-factor agent is present and expecting a different credential at the RDP logon screen, this initial connection may result in a failed logon attempt, and also effectively cause a “double logon” requirement for each and every new RDP session.

            **Impact:**

            When event logs fill to capacity, they will stop recording information unless the retention method for each is set so that the computer will overwrite the oldest entries with the most recent ones. To mitigate the risk of loss of recent data, you can configure the retention method so that older events are overwritten as needed.

            The consequence of this configuration is that older events will be removed from the logs. Attackers can take advantage of such a configuration, because they can generate a large number of extraneous events to overwrite any evidence of their attack. These risks can be somewhat reduced if you automate the archival and backup of event log data.

            Ideally, all specifically monitored events should be sent to a server that uses Microsoft System Center Operations Manager (SCOM) or some other automated monitoring tool. Such a configuration is particularly important because an attacker who successfully compromises a server could clear the Security log. If all events are sent to a monitoring server, then you will be able to gather forensic information about the attacker's activities.

        This check ensures that the 'Set client connection encryption level' setting is configured to 'Enabled: High Level'. This setting ensures that communications between client computers and RD Session Host servers during Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) connections are secured using a high encryption level.

        **Why this matters**

        Configuring a high encryption level for RDP connections is important for the following reasons:
          •  It ensures that data transmitted during RDP sessions is encrypted, protecting it from interception and unauthorized access.
          •  It aligns with security best practices and compliance requirements for secure remote access.
          •  It reduces the risk of sensitive information being exposed during remote sessions.

        If a high encryption level is not enforced, it can lead to:
          •  Interception of sensitive data during RDP sessions.
          •  Unauthorized access to remote systems.
          •  Non-compliance with security benchmarks such as CIS Windows Benchmarks and NIST 800-53.

        By ensuring that the 'Set client connection encryption level' is configured to 'Enabled: High Level', organizations can enhance the security of remote connections, protect sensitive data, and maintain compliance with security best practices.

To mitigate the risk of loss of recent data, you can configure the retention method so that older events are overwritten as needed.

            The consequence of this configuration is that older events will be removed from the logs. Attackers can take advantage of such a configuration, because they can generate a large number of extraneous events to overwrite any evidence of their attack. These risks can be somewhat reduced if you automate the archival and backup of event log data.

            Ideally, all specifically monitored events should be sent to a server that uses Microsoft System Center Operations Manager (SCOM) or some other automated monitoring tool. Such a configuration is particularly important because an attacker who successfully compromises a server could clear the Security log. If all events are sent to a monitoring server, then you will be able to gather forensic information about the attacker's activities.

        This policy setting determines whether the operating system stores passwords in a way that uses reversible encryption, which provides support for application protocols that require knowledge of the user's password for authentication purposes. Passwords that are stored with reversible encryption are essentially the same as plaintext versions of the passwords.

        The recommended state for this setting is: `Disabled`.

        **Note:**
        Password Policy settings (section 1.1) and Account Lockout Policy settings (section 1.2) must be applied via the **Default Domain Policy**
        GPO in order to be globally in effect on **domain**
        user accounts as their default behavior. If these settings are configured in another GPO, they will only affect **local**
        user accounts on the computers that receive the GPO. However, custom exceptions to the default password policy and account lockout policy rules for specific domain users and/or groups can be defined using Password Settings Objects (PSOs), which are completely separate from Group Policy and most easily configured using Active Directory Administrative Center.

        This check ensures that the maximum size of the 'System' event log file is configured to at least 32,768 kilobytes. This setting ensures sufficient space for logging critical system events without frequent overwrites.

        **Why this matters**

        Configuring an adequate maximum log file size is essential for the following reasons:
          •  It ensures that critical system events are retained for a longer period, aiding in troubleshooting and forensic analysis.
          •  Prevents frequent overwriting of logs, which can lead to the loss of important event data.
          •  Aligns with security benchmarks and best practices for event log management.

        If the maximum log file size is set too low, it can lead to:
          •  Loss of critical event data due to frequent overwrites.
          •  Difficulty in diagnosing system issues or investigating security incidents.
          •  Non-compliance with security benchmarks such as CIS Windows Benchmarks and NIST 800-53.

        By ensuring that the maximum log file size is set to 32,768 kilobytes or greater, organizations can enhance event log retention, improve system monitoring, and maintain compliance with security best practices.

        This check ensures that the 'Turn off multicast name resolution' setting is enabled. This setting disables the Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution (LLMNR) protocol, which is used for name resolution on local networks.

        **Why this matters**

        Disabling LLMNR is important for the following reasons:
          •  It prevents attackers from exploiting LLMNR to perform man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks or capture sensitive information.
          •  LLMNR is often unnecessary in environments where DNS is properly configured, and its use can introduce security vulnerabilities.
          •  Disabling LLMNR reduces the attack surface and aligns with security best practices.

        If LLMNR is enabled, it can lead to:
          •  Unauthorized interception of network traffic and sensitive data.
          •  Exploitation of name resolution vulnerabilities by attackers.
          •  Non-compliance with security benchmarks such as CIS Windows Benchmarks and NIST 800-53.
