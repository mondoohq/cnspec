        ## Overview

        This policy bundle verifies best practices for authenticating email messages using security protocols such as Sender Policy Framework (SPF), Domain Keys Identified Mail (DKIM), and Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance (DMARC).

        ### Running the Policy

        ```
        cnspec scan host mondoo.com -f mondoo-email-security.mql.yaml
        ```

         ## Join the community!

        Our goal is to build policies that are simple to deploy, accurate, and actionable.

        If you have any suggestions for how to improve this policy, or if you need support, [join the community](https://github.com/orgs/mondoohq/discussions) in GitHub Discussions.

    docs:
      desc: |
        Reverse DNS queries for IPv4 addresses use the special domain in-addr.arpa. In this domain, the IPv4 address is represented as a concatenated sequence of four decimal numbers separated by periods, to which is added the second-level domain suffix .in-addr.arpa. The four decimal numbers are obtained by splitting the 32-bit IPv4 address into four octets and converting each octet to a decimal number. These decimal numbers are then arranged in the following order: the smallest octet is first (leftmost) and the most significant octet is last (rightmost). It is important to note that this is the reverse order of the usual convention for writing IPv4 addresses in text form.

        For example, to query the IP address 8.8.4.4 in reverse order, the PTR record for the domain name 4.4.8.8.in-addr.arpa is queried, which points to dns.google.

        If the A record for dns.google in turn points back to 8.8.4.4, it means that the domain is in a [forward-confirmed reverse DNS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward-confirmed_reverse_DNS) state.

        This creates a form of authentication, which is strong enough to be used for whitelisting purposes of email servers.
        According to Google's latest guidelines:

        "Your sending IP address must have a PTR record. PTR records verify that the sending hostname is associated with the sending IP address.
        Every IP address must map to a hostname in the PTR record. The hostname specified in the PTR record must have a forward DNS that refers to the sending IP address."
      audit: Run the `dig -t PTR <special-reverse-domain>` command and verify that the it points to your mail domain.
      remediation: |
        Set up valid reverse DNS records of your sending server IP addresses that point to your domain.

        Receiving email servers regularly send DMARC Aggregate Reports (RUA) to all domains that have an adequately implemented DMARC policy. These reports contain encrypted aggregate statistics in XML format and are sent to the email addresses specified in the RUA tag of the DMARC record. In simpler terms, the RUA tag is used to specify one or more email addresses where you want to receive DMARC Aggregate Reports.

        The RUF (or DMARC Failure or Forensic Report) tag was designed to inform domain administrators when emails fail SPF, DKIM, and DMARC authentication checks. The report includes sensitive details about the email, such as the header, subject, URLs, and attachments. However, many organizations prefer not to request RUF reports due to privacy and compliance concerns. The main goal is to comply with privacy laws and prevent data breaches.
      audit: Run the `dig TXT _dmarc.<domain>` command and verify that the DMARC RUF tag is configured.
