        ## Overview

        Google Cloud Security by Mondoo provides guidance for establishing minimum recommended security and operational best practices for Google Cloud.

        ## Remote scan

        Remote scans use cnspec providers to retrieve on-demand scan results without having to install any agents.

        For a complete list of providers run:

        ```bash
        cnspec scan --help
        ```

        ### Prerequisites

        Remote scans of Google Cloud Projects requires API credentials with access to the project.

        ### Scan a GCP project

        Open a terminal and authenticate with Google Cloud:

        ```bash
        gcloud auth login
        ```

        Run a scan of a GCP project:

        ```bash
        cnspec scan gcp
        ```

        To target a specific project:

        ```bash
        gcloud config set project <project_id>
        ```

        ```bash
        cnspec scan gcp
        ```

        New projects that have enabled the Compute Engine API have a Compute Engine default service account, which contains the following email pattern:

        ```bash
        -compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com
        ```

        The Compute Engine default service account is created with the IAM basic Editor role, but you can modify your service account's roles to control the service account's access to Google APIs.

        You can disable or delete this service account from your project, but doing so might cause any applications that depend on the service account's credentials to fail. If you accidentally delete the Compute Engine default service account, you can try to recover the account within 30 days. For more information, see Creating and managing service accounts.

        It is recommended that you do not configure instances with the default service account. Instead, create a user account using the principle of least privilege.

           gcloud config set project <project_id>
           ```

        2. Run this query:

          ```mql
          cnquery run gcp project <project-id> -c "gcp.compute.instances.where( name != /^gke/ ) {id name serviceAccounts.where( email == /^.*compute@developer\.gserviceaccount\.com$/ )}"
          ```

        __cnquery shell__

        To audit your Google Cloud Project with `cnquery shell`:

        ### Terraform

        To provision or update a compute instance with a custom service account:

        ```hcl
        resource "google_compute_instance" "default" {
          name         = "secure-instance"
          machine_type = var.machine_type
          zone         = var.zone
          tags = ["terraform"]

          service_account {
            email  = "example@example.com"
            scopes = ["user-email", "compute-ro", "storage-ro"]
          }
        }
        ```

        ### Google Cloud Console

        To change the policy using the GCP Console, follow these steps:

        1. Log in to the GCP Console at https://console.cloud.google.com.
        2. Select the Organization and Project where the instance you want to update is running.
        3. Navigate to **Compute Engine**.
        4. Select the compute instance that you want to update.
        5. If the instance is not stopped, select **Stop**. Wait for the instance to stop.
        6. Select **Edit**.
        7. Scroll down to the Service Account section.
        8. Select a different service account.
        9. Select **Save**.
        10. Select **START**.

        ### gcloud cli

        To update the service account using the `gcloud` cli:

        1. Stop the instance:

          ```bash
          gcloud compute instances stop INSTANCE_NAME

         2. Launch `cnquery shell`:

           ```bash
           cnquery shell gcp
           ```

         3. Run this query:

           ```mql

        ### Terraform

        To update public access configuration using Terraform, ensure `allUsers` and `allAuthenticatedUsers` are not set:

        ```hcl
        resource "google_storage_bucket_iam_binding" "binding" {
          bucket = google_storage_bucket.default.name
          role = "roles/storage.admin"
          members = [
            "user:jane@example.com",
          ]
        }
        ```

        ```hcl
        resource "google_storage_bucket_iam_member" "member" {
          bucket = google_storage_bucket.default.name
          role = "roles/storage.admin"
          member = "user:jane@example.com"
        }
        ```

        ### Google Cloud Console
        1. In the Google Cloud console, go to the **Cloud Storage Bucket** page.
        2. For the bucket you want to enforce public access prevention on, select the more actions menu.
        3. Select **Edit access** from the drop-down menu.
        4. In the Public access card, select **Prevent public access** to enforce public access prevention.
        5. Select **Confirm**.

        ### gcloud cli

        Update an existing storage bucket with the `gcloud` cli:

        ```bash
        gcloud storage buckets update gs://BUCKET_NAME --no-pap
        ```

        Cloud Storage offers two systems for granting users permission to access your buckets and objects: IAM and Access Control Lists (ACLs). These systems act in parallel - in order for a user to access a Cloud Storage resource, only one of the systems needs to grant the user permission. IAM is used throughout Google Cloud and allows you to grant a variety of permissions at the bucket and project levels. ACLs are used only by Cloud Storage and have limited permission options, but they allow you to grant permissions on a per-object basis.

        It is recommended to enable uniform bucket-level access on Cloud Storage buckets. Uniform bucket-level access is used to unify and simplify how you grant access to your Cloud Storage resources. Cloud Storage offers two systems that act in parallel to grant users permission to access buckets and objects:

         To audit your Google Cloud Project with `cnquery run`:

         1. Ensure the `gcloud` cli is configured to the GCP project:

           ```bash
           gcloud config set project <project_id>
           ```

         2. Run this query:

           ```bash
           cnquery run gcp -c "gcloud.storage.buckets { iamConfiguration['UniformBucketLevelAccess']['Enabled'] }"
           ```

         __cnquery shell__

         To audit your Google Cloud Project with `cnquery shell`:

         1. Ensure the `gcloud` cli is configured to the GCP project:

           ```bash
           gcloud config set project <project_id>
           ```

         2. Launch `cnquery shell`:

           ```bash
           cnquery shell gcp

        ```hcl
        resource "google_storage_bucket" "example" {
          name     = "test-bucket"
          bucket_policy_only = true

        ```

        ### Google Cloud Console

        1. In the Google Cloud console, go to the **Cloud Storage Buckets** page.
        2. In the list of buckets, select the name of the desired bucket.
        3. Select the **Permissions** tab near the top of the page.
        4. In the text box named **Access Control**, select the **Switch to** link. Note that the text box disappears 90 days after you enable uniform bucket-level access.
        5. In the pop-up menu that appears, select **Fine-grained**.
        6. Select **Save**.
