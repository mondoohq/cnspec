        New projects that have enabled the Compute Engine API have a Compute Engine default service account, which has the following email:

        ```bash
        PROJECT_NUMBER-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com
        ```

        The Compute Engine default service account is created with the IAM basic Editor role, but you can modify your service account's roles to control the service account's access to Google APIs.

        You can disable or delete this service account from your project, but doing so might cause any applications that depend on the service account's credentials to fail. If you accidentally delete the Compute Engine default service account, you can try to recover the account within 30 days. For more information, see Creating and managing service accounts.

        It is recommended that you do not configure instances with the default service account. Instead, create a user account using the principle of least privilege.

        Cloud Storage offers two systems for granting users permission to access your buckets and objects: IAM and Access Control Lists (ACLs). These systems act in parallel - in order for a user to access a Cloud Storage resource, only one of the systems needs to grant the user permission. IAM is used throughout Google Cloud and allows you to grant a variety of permissions at the bucket and project levels. ACLs are used only by Cloud Storage and have limited permission options, but they allow you to grant permissions on a per-object basis.

        It is recommended to enable uniform bucket-level access on Cloud Storage buckets. Uniform bucket-level access is used to unify and simplify how you grant access to your Cloud Storage resources. Cloud Storage offers two systems that act in parallel to grant users permission to access buckets and objects:
