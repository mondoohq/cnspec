        # Overview

        GitHub Repository Best Practices by Mondoo provides assessments of public and private GitHub repositories to ensure a minimum recommended operational best practices.

        ## About remote scanning

        Remote scans with cnspec provide on demand security assessments of infrastructure and services without the need to install any agents or integrations. cnspec comes with a growing list of providers to connect and scan local and remote targets.

        A complete list of providers can be found by running this command:

        ```bash
        cnspec scan --help
        ```

        ### cnspec GitHub provider

        This policy uses the `github` provider to authenticate with GitHub's API in order to remotely scan GitHub repositories. Additional information on the `github` provider can be found by running this command:

        ```bash
        cnspec scan github --help
        ```

        ## Configuring the GitHub provider

        The `github` provider for cnspec requires a GitHub personal access token to authenticate with GitHub's API. The personal access token is required regardless of whether you are scanning a public or a private repository. Access to private repositories is determined by the level of access the token cnspec is configured with when it runs.

        ### Create a personal access token

        To create a read-only personal access token, see [Creating a personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) on GitHub's documentation site.

        ### Configure a GITHUB_TOKEN environment variable

        You supply your personal access token to cnspec using the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable.

        #### Linux / macOS

        ```bash
        export GITHUB_TOKEN=<your personal access token>
        ```

        #### Windows

        ```powershell
        $Env:GITHUB_TOKEN = "<personal-access-token>"
        ```

        ## Scanning GitHub repositories

        To scan the configuration of a GitHub repository:

        ```bash
        cnspec scan github repo <ORG_NAME/REPO_NAME>
        ```

        GitHub repositories should include a SUPPORT.md file to let people know how to get help with the project.

        To direct people to specific support resources, you can add a SUPPORT.md file to your repository's root, docs, or .github directory. When someone creates an issue in your repository, they will see a link to your project's SUPPORT.md file.

    docs:

        Check tries to determine if the project has published a license. It works by checking standard locations for a file named according to common license conventions.

        A license can give users information about how the source code may or may not be used. The lack of a license will impede any kind of security review or audit and creates a legal risk for potential users.
