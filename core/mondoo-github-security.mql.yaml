        ## Overview

        The Mondoo GitHub Organization Security policy provides guidance for establishing minimum recommended security and operational best practices for GitHub organizations.

        ## About remote scanning

        Remote scans with cnspec provide on demand security assessments of infrastructure and services without installing any agents or integrations. cnspec comes with a growing list of providers to connect and scan local and remote targets.

        A complete list of providers can be found by running this command:

        ```bash
        cnspec scan --help
        ```

        ### cnspec GitHub provider

        This policy uses the `github` provider to authenticate with GitHub's API in order to remotely scan GitHub organizations. Additional information on the `github` provider can be found by running this command:

        ```bash
        cnspec scan github --help
        ```

        ## Configuring the GitHub provider

        The `github` provider for cnspec requires a GitHub personal access token to authenticate with GitHub's API. Access to an organization is determined by the level of access the token cnspec is configured with when it runs.

        ### Create a personal access token

        To create a read-only personal access token, see [Creating a personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) on GitHub's documentation site.

        ### Configure a GITHUB_TOKEN environment variable

        You supply your personal access token to cnspec using the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable.

        #### Linux / macOS

        ```bash
        export GITHUB_TOKEN=<your personal access token>
        ```

        #### Windows

        ```powershell
        $Env:GITHUB_TOKEN = "<personal-access-token>"
        ```

        ## Scan a GitHub organization

        To scan the configuration of your GitHub organization, run this command:

        ```bash
        cnspec scan github org <ORG_NAME>
        ```

        ## Scan a GitHub organization and all repositories

        cnspec can also scan a GitHub organization and all of its repositories using the `--discover all` flag. To scan your GitHub organization and discover and scan all of the repositories within your organization, run this command:

        ```bash
        cnspec scan github org <ORG_NAME> --discover all
        ```

        > Note: Scanning large GitHub organizations may exceed GitHub API rate limits. For more information see [About rate limits](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/rate-limit?apiVersion=2022-11-28#about-rate-limits) in the GitHub documentation.

        # Overview

        GitHub Repository Security by Mondoo provides security assessments of public and private GitHub repositories to ensure minimum recommended security and operational best practices. This policy is also designed to assess public repositories and open source projects your team depends on to evaluate the risk a project poses to your business. Open source projects that do not adhere to GitHub's recommended security best practices pose a higher risk of malicious code making its way into your environments.

        ## About remote scanning

        Remote scans with cnspec provide on demand security assessments of infrastructure and services without installing any agents or integrations. cnspec comes with a growing list of providers to connect and scan local and remote targets.

        A complete list of providers can be found by running this command:

        ```bash
        cnspec scan --help
        ```

        ### cnspec GitHub Provider

        This policy uses the `github` provider to authenticate with GitHub's API in order to remotely scan GitHub repositories. Additional information on the `github` provider can be found by running this command:

        ```bash
        cnspec scan github --help
        ```

        ## Configuring the GitHub provider

        The `github` provider for cnspec requires a GitHub personal access token to authenticate with GitHub's API. The personal access token is required regardless of whether you are scanning a public or a private repository. Access to private repositories is determined by the level of access the token cnspec is configured with when it runs.

        ### Create a personal access token

        To create a read-only personal access token, see [Creating a personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) on GitHub's documentation site.

        ### Configure a GITHUB_TOKEN environment variable

        You supply your personal access token to cnspec using the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable.

        #### Linux / macOS

        ```bash
        export GITHUB_TOKEN=<your personal access token>
        ```

        #### Windows

        ```powershell
        $Env:GITHUB_TOKEN = "<personal-access-token>"
        ```

        ## Scanning GitHub repositories

        To scan the configuration of a GitHub repository:

        ```bash
        cnspec scan github repo <ORG_NAME/REPO_NAME>
        ```

        Two-factor authentication (2FA) is an extra layer of security used when logging into websites or apps. With 2FA, you have to log in with your username and password and provide another form of authentication that only you know or have access to. It is highly recommended that GitHub Organizations are configured to require all users to configure 2FA.

Branch protection enforces certain workflows or requirements are met before a collaborator can push changes to a branch in a repository. It is highly recommended to disable force pushes to the default repository branch. By default, GitHub blocks force pushes on all protected branches. When you enable force pushes to a protected branch, you can choose one of two groups who can force push:

        - Allow everyone with at least write permissions to the repository to force push to the branch, including those with admin permissions.
        - Allow only specific people or teams to force push to the branch.

        If someone force pushes to a branch, the force push may overwrite commits that other collaborators based their work on. People may have merge conflicts or corrupted pull requests.

        Enabling force pushes will not override any other branch protection rules. For example, if a branch requires a linear commit history, you cannot force push merge commits to that branch.

        This check ensures a branch protection rule exists to require signed commits on the default branch. Signing commits and tags locally gives other people confidence about the origin of changes made to a project. If a commit or tag has a GPG, SSH, or S/MIME signature that is cryptographically verifiable, GitHub marks the commit or tag "Verified" or "Partially verified."

        This check determines whether the project has generated executable (binary) artifacts in the source repository. Binary artifacts pose security challenges because they cannot be reviewed, and users will often directly use executables if they are included in the source repository, leading to many dangerous behaviors.

        This check ensures the existence of a GitHub Actions workflow to run Dependabot checks on the repository by looking for the existence of a `.github/dependabot.yml` or `.github/dependabot.yaml` configuration file.
        Dependabot creates pull requests to keep your dependencies up to date, and you can use GitHub Actions to perform automated tasks when these pull requests are created. For example, fetch additional artifacts, add labels, run tests, or otherwise modifying the pull request.
      remediation: |
        GitHub Actions provides many different workflows for running Dependabot checks on a project. For more information see [Automating Dependabot with GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot/working-with-dependabot/automating-dependabot-with-github-actions) in the GitHub documentation site.
