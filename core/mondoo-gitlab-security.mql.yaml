        The Mondoo GitLab Security policy offers guidance on establishing minimum recommended security best practices for GitLab groups and projects.

        ### Prerequisites

        Remote scans of GitLab require a [personal access token](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/personal_access_tokens.html) with access to the group and projects you plan to scan.

        ### Scan a GitLab group and projects

        Open a terminal and configure an environment variable with your GitLab personal access token:

        ```bash
        export GITLAB_TOKEN=<your personal access token>
        ```

        Run a remote scan of your GitLab group:

        ```bash
        cnspec scan gitlab --group <group_name>
        ```

        ### Scan a single GitLab project

        Open a terminal and configure an environment variable with your GitLab personal access token:

        ```bash
        export GITLAB_TOKEN=<your personal access token>
        ```

        Scan a GitLab group:

        ```bash
        cnspec scan gitlab --group <group_name> --project <project_name>
        ```

    title: Ensure the group is private

      gitlab.group.visibility != "public"
    docs:
      desc: |
        GitLab allows users with the Owner role to set a group's visibility as:

        - Public
        - Internal
        - Private

        These visibility levels affect who can see the project in the public access directory (/public for your GitLab instance). For example, https://gitlab.com/public. You can control the visibility of individual features with project feature settings.

        Private projects can only be cloned and viewed by project members (except for guests). They appear in the public access directory (`/public``) for project members only.
      remediation: |
        To make the visibility of a GitLab group private, see [Change group visibility](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/public_access.html#change-group-visibility).

      gitlab.group.requireTwoFactorAuthentication == true
    docs:
      desc: |
        Two-factor authentication (2FA) provides an additional layer of security to your users' GitLab accounts. When enabled, users are prompted for a code generated by an application in addition to supplying their username and password to sign in.
      remediation: |
        GitLab offers several options to configure 2FA for your users. To enable MFA in your GitLab, see [Enforce two-factor authentication](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/security/two_factor_authentication.html) on the GitLab documentation site.
