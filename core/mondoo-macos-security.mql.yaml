This guide was tested against Apple macOS 10, 11, 12, and 13.\n\n## Local scan\n\nLocal scan refer to scans of files and operating systems where `cnspec` is installed.\n\nTo scan the `localhost` against this policy: \n\n```bash\ncnspec scan local \n```\n\n## Remote scan\n\nRemote scans use native transports in `cnspec` to provide on demand scan results without the need to install any agents, or integration. \n\nFor a complete list of native transports run: \n\n```bash\ncnspec scan --help\n```\n\n### Prerequisites\n\nRemote scans of macOS hosts requires **Remote login** to be enabled in the System Preferences, along with a suitable authentication method such as SSH keys.\n\n### Scan a remote macOS (SSH authentication)\n\n```bash\ncnspec scan ssh <user>@<IP_ADDRESS> -i /path/to/ssh_key \n```\n\n## Join the community!\n\nOur goal is to build policies that are simple to deploy, accurate, and actionable. \n\nIf you have any suggestions on how to improve this policy, or if you need support, [join the community](https://github.com/orgs/mondoohq/discussions) in GitHub Discussions.

        Do you really want to turn remote login off? If you do, you will lose this connection and can only turn it back on locally at the server (yes/no)?
        ```

        Entering yes will disable remote login.

        **Impact:**

        The SSH server built-in to macOS should not be enabled on a standard user computer, particularly one that changes locations and IP addresses. A standard user that runs local applications, including email, web browser and productivity tools, should not use the same device as a server. There are Enterprise management tool-sets that do utilize SSH. If they are in use, the computer should be locked down to only respond to known, trusted IP addresses and appropriate admin service accounts.

        For macOS computers that are being used for specialized functions, there are several options to harden the SSH server to protect against unauthorized access including brute force attacks. There are some basic criteria that need to be considered:

        - Do not open an SSH server to the internet without controls in place to mitigate SSH brute force attacks. This is particularly important for systems bound to Directory environments. It is great to have controls in place to protect the system, but if they trigger after the user is already locked out of their account, they are not optimal. If authorization happens after authentication directory accounts for users that don't even use the system can be locked out.
        - Do not use SSH key pairs when there is no insight to the security of the client system that will authenticate into the server with a private key. If an attacker gets access to the remote system and can find the key they may not need a password or a key logger to access the SSH server.
        - Detailed instructions on hardening an SSH server, if needed, are available in the CIS Linux Benchmarks, but it is beyond the scope of this benchmark.

It is possible that sharing is required and Bluetooth peripherals are not. Bluetooth must be enabled if sharing is an acceptable use case.

        Starting with 10.13 (macOS High Sierra) Apple introduced a service to make it easier to deploy data from Apple, including software updates, where there are bandwidth constraints to the Internet and fewer constraints and greater bandwidth on the local subnet. This capability can be very valuable for organizations that have throttled and possibly metered Internet connections. In heterogeneous enterprise networks with multiple subnets the effectiveness of this capability would be determined on how many Macs were on each subnet at the time new large updates were made available upstream.
        This capability requires the use of mac OS clients as P2P nodes for updated Apple content. Unless there is a business requirement to manage operational Internet connectivity bandwidth user endpoints should not store content and act as a cluster to provision data.

        AirDrop is Apple's built-in on demand ad hoc file exchange system that is compatible with both macOS and iOS. It uses Bluetooth LE for discovery that limits connectivity to Mac or iOS users that are in close proximity. Depending on the setting it allows everyone or only Contacts to share files when they are nearby to each other.

        In many ways this technology is far superior to the alternatives. The file transfer is done over a TLS encrypted session, does not require any open ports that are required for file sharing, does not leave file copies on email servers or within cloud storage, and allows for the service to be mitigated so that only people already trusted and added to contacts can interact with you.

        While there are positives to AirDrop, there are privacy concerns that could expose personal information. For that reason, AirDrop should be disabled, and should only be enabled when needed and disabled afterwards.

      desc: |-
        macOS writes information pertaining to system-related events to the file `/var/log/install.log`
        and has a configurable retention policy for this file. The default logging setting limits the file size of the logs and the maximum size for all logs. The default allows for an errant application to fill the log files and does not enforce sufficient log retention. The Benchmark recommends a value based on standard use cases. The value should align with local requirements within the organization.

        The default value has an "all_max" file limitation, no reference to a minimum retention and a less precise rotation argument.

        The all_max flag control will remove old log entries based only on the size of the log files. Log size can vary widely depending on how verbose installing applications are in their log entries. The decision here is to ensure that logs go back a year and depending on the applications a size restriction could compromise the ability to store a full year.

        While this Benchmark is not scoring for a rotation flag the default rotation is sequential rather than using a timestamp. Auditors may prefer timestamps in order to simply review specific dates where event information is desired.

        Please review the File Rotation section in the man page for more information.

        ```
        man asl.conf
        ```

        - The maximum file size limitation string should be removed "all_max="
        - An organization appropriate retention should be added "ttl="
        - The rotation should be set with timestamps "rotate=utc" or "rotate=local"
