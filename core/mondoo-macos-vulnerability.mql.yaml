        ## Overview

        Mondoo macOS Vulnerability Policy checks for macOS vulnerabilities. It should be used in combination with the macOS Security Policy.

        ### Run policy

        To run this policy against a macOS system:

        ```bash
        cnspec scan local -f core/mondoo-macos-vulnerability.mql.yaml
        ```

        ## Join the community!

        Our goal is to build policies that are simple to deploy, accurate, and actionable.

        If you have any suggestions on how to improve this policy, or if you need support, [join the community](https://github.com/orgs/mondoohq/discussions) in GitHub Discussions.
