        This check ensures that policies are in place to detect risky sign-ins in real-time and offline. Risky sign-ins refer to attempts that may be performed by unauthorized individuals trying to access user accounts.

        **Why this matters**

        Risky sign-ins are a key indicator of potential account compromise. Detecting and responding to these events promptly is critical to safeguarding sensitive data and maintaining the security of user accounts. Policies that monitor and flag risky sign-ins help organizations identify suspicious activities, such as sign-ins from unfamiliar locations, unusual devices, or atypical behavior patterns.

        Without such policies, organizations may fail to detect unauthorized access attempts, leaving accounts vulnerable to compromise. This can lead to data breaches, unauthorized access to sensitive information, and potential compliance violations.

        Implementing policies to detect risky sign-ins supports a proactive security posture and aligns with best practices for identity and access management. It also helps organizations meet compliance requirements for standards such as:
          - ISO/IEC 27001 (A.9.4.2: Secure log-on procedures)
          - NIST 800-53 (AC-7: Unsuccessful Login Attempts)
          - CIS Controls (CIS Control 16: Account Monitoring and Control)

        Ensuring these policies are in place strengthens account security and contributes to an organization's overall defense-in-depth strategy for protecting user identities and access to critical resources.
        This check ensures that there are some policies in place which can detect risky sign-in in real-time and offline. A risky sign-in mainly means a sign-in attempt which might be performed by illegitimate owner of a user account.

        This check ensures that legacy authentication protocols are disabled in Microsoft 365.

        **Why this matters**

        Legacy authentication protocols, such as POP, IMAP, and SMTP, do not support modern security features like multi-factor authentication (MFA). These protocols are often targeted by attackers as they provide an easier entry point for unauthorized access to user accounts.

        Disabling legacy authentication reduces the attack surface by preventing the use of outdated protocols that lack robust security measures. This helps protect sensitive data, prevent unauthorized access, and align with best practices for securing cloud environments.

        Without disabling legacy authentication, organizations risk exposing their accounts to brute force attacks, credential stuffing, and other malicious activities. This can lead to data breaches, compliance violations, and reputational damage.

        Ensuring legacy authentication is disabled strengthens the security posture of an organization and supports compliance with standards such as:
          - ISO/IEC 27001 (A.9.4.2: Secure log-on procedures)
          - NIST 800-53 (AC-7: Unsuccessful Login Attempts)
          - CIS Controls (CIS Control 16: Account Monitoring and Control)

        Disabling legacy authentication is a critical step in implementing a modern, secure authentication framework for Microsoft 365.

          - Under `Assignments` enable `All users`
          - Under `Assignments` and `Users and groups` set the `Exclude` to be at least one low risk account or directory role. This is required as a best practice.

        This check ensures that multi-factor authentication (MFA) is enabled for all users in administrative roles within the Microsoft 365 tenant.

        **Why this matters**

        Enabling MFA for administrative roles adds an essential layer of security to protect privileged accounts from unauthorized access. Administrative accounts are high-value targets for attackers, as they have elevated permissions that can be exploited to compromise the entire environment.

        Without MFA, administrative accounts are more vulnerable to credential theft, phishing attacks, and brute force attempts. This can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and potential compliance violations.

        Implementing MFA for administrative roles aligns with security best practices and compliance requirements, such as:
          - ISO/IEC 27001 (A.9.4.2: Secure log-on procedures)
          - NIST 800-53 (IA-2: Identification and Authentication)
          - CIS Controls (CIS Control 16: Account Monitoring and Control)

        Ensuring MFA is enabled for administrative roles strengthens the security posture of the organization and reduces the risk of unauthorized access to critical resources.

    docs:
      desc: |
        This check ensures that the security defaults (which are enabled by default) are disabled in Azure Active Directory.

        **Why this matters**

        Security defaults are a set of basic identity security mechanisms provided by Microsoft to protect organizations from common identity-related attacks. While they offer a good starting point for securing identities, they may not meet the specific needs of all organizations.

        Disabling security defaults allows organizations to implement custom Conditional Access policies tailored to their unique security requirements. This enables more granular control over access to resources, such as enforcing multi-factor authentication (MFA) for specific users or applications, blocking legacy authentication protocols, and applying risk-based access controls.

        Without disabling security defaults, organizations may face limitations in implementing advanced security configurations. This can hinder their ability to align with best practices and compliance requirements, such as:
          - ISO/IEC 27001 (A.9.4.2: Secure log-on procedures)
          - NIST 800-53 (AC-7: Unsuccessful Login Attempts)
          - CIS Controls (CIS Control 16: Account Monitoring and Control)

        Disabling security defaults and implementing custom Conditional Access policies strengthens the organization's security posture and provides greater flexibility in managing access to critical resources.

        Note: Using security defaults prohibits custom settings. Many best security practices require custom settings.
      remediation: |
        **To disable security defaults:**

        1. Navigate to the `Microsoft Entra admin center` https://entra.microsoft.com.
        2. Select to expand `Identity` select `Overview`
        3. Select `Properties`.
        4. Select `Manage security defaults`.
        5. Set the `Security defaults` dropdown to `Disabled`.
        6. Select Save.

        **To configure security defaults using Microsoft Graph PowerShell:**

        1. Connect to the Microsoft Graph service using `Connect-MgGraph -Scopes "Policy.ReadWrite.ConditionalAccess"`.
        2. Run the following Microsoft Graph PowerShell command:

        ```powershell
        $params = @{ IsEnabled = $false }
        Update-MgPolicyIdentitySecurityDefaultEnforcementPolicy -BodyParameter $params
        ```

        **WARNING:** It is recommended not to disable security defaults until you are ready to implement conditional access rules in the benchmark. Rules such as requiring MFA for all users and blocking legacy protocols are required in CA in order to make up the gap by disabling defaults. Plan accordingly. See the reference section for more details on what coverage Security Defaults provide.

        This check ensures that there are enough Global Admins in a single tenant.

        **Why this matters**

        When it comes to designating global admins, it's important to consider the size and complexity of the organization, as well as the level of responsibility and authority required for the role. As a general rule, it's a good idea to have at least three global admins to ensure that there is redundancy and coverage in case one admin is unavailable or leaves the organization.

        At the same time, having too many global admins can lead to confusion and inefficiency, as multiple people may be making decisions or taking actions without proper coordination. Therefore, it's recommended to keep the number of global admins to no more than four, unless the organization is particularly large or complex and requires more administrators to properly manage its operations.

        Ensuring the appropriate number of global admins strengthens the organization's ability to manage its operations effectively while maintaining security and operational efficiency.
      remediation: |
        **To correct the number of global tenant administrators:**

        1. Navigate to the `Microsoft 365 admin center` https://admin.microsoft.com
        2. Select `Users` > `Active Users`.
        3. In the `Search` field enter the name of the user to be made a Global Administrator.
        4. To create a new Global Admin:
          1. Select the user's name.

        This check ensures that encryption in Android mobile devices has been enabled to prevent any unauthorized access to the data.

        **Why this matters**

        Encryption ensures that sensitive data stored on mobile devices is protected from unauthorized access, even if the device is lost or stolen. Without encryption, attackers can easily access data by bypassing basic security measures.

        Implementing encryption aligns with security best practices and compliance requirements, such as:
          - ISO/IEC 27001 (A.10.1.1: Policy on the use of cryptographic controls)
          - NIST 800-53 (SC-12: Cryptographic Key Establishment and Management)
          - CIS Controls (CIS Control 13: Data Protection)

        Enabling encryption on mobile devices strengthens the organization's security posture and reduces the risk of data breaches.

        This check ensures that there is a minimum password length - at least eight characters - for mobile devices.

        **Why this matters**

        According to NIST (SP 800-63-2), user-chosen memorized secrets should be a minimum of 8 characters long. Enforcing a minimum password length helps protect against brute force attacks and ensures stronger security for mobile devices.

        Without a minimum password length, attackers can exploit weak passwords, increasing the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive data. Implementing this policy aligns with security best practices and compliance requirements, such as:
          - ISO/IEC 27001 (A.9.4.3: Password management system)
          - NIST 800-53 (IA-5: Authenticator Management)

        This check ensures that Microsoft 365 passwords are set to never expire. Based on new research from several organizations, it has been confirmed that forcing users to change their passwords frequently can lead to weaker password practices and reduced security.

        **Why this matters**

        Forcing users to change their passwords regularly often results in predictable patterns or weaker passwords, as users may resort to minor variations of their previous passwords. This behavior can make it easier for attackers to guess or compromise passwords.

        Allowing passwords to never expire, combined with strong password policies and multi-factor authentication (MFA), provides a more secure and user-friendly approach. This aligns with modern security best practices and compliance requirements, such as:
          - ISO/IEC 27001 (A.9.4.3: Password management system)
          - NIST 800-63 (IA-5: Authenticator Management)
          - CIS Controls (CIS Control 16: Account Monitoring and Control)

        Ensuring that passwords do not expire unnecessarily strengthens the organization's security posture while reducing the burden on users.

        **To set Microsoft 365 passwords to never expire:**

        1. Navigate to the `Microsoft 365 admin center` at https://admin.microsoft.com.
        2. Go to `Settings` > `Org settings`.
        3. Under the `Security & privacy` tab, locate and select `Password expiration policy`.
        4. Check the box for `Set passwords to never expire (recommended)`.
        5. Select `Save changes`.

        **To set Microsoft 365 passwords to never expire using the Microsoft Graph PowerShell module:**

        1. Connect to the Microsoft Graph service using `Connect-MgGraph -Scopes "Domain.ReadWrite.All"`.
        2. Run the following Microsoft Graph PowerShell command:

        ```powershell
        Update-MgDomain -DomainId <Domain> -PasswordValidityPeriodInDays 2147483647 -PasswordNotificationWindowInDays 30
        ```

        This check ensures that SPF records are created for each domain in Exchange.

        **Why this matters**

        Sender Policy Framework (SPF) records are a critical component of email authentication. They help prevent email spoofing by specifying which mail servers are authorized to send emails on behalf of a domain. Without SPF records, attackers can impersonate your domain to send fraudulent emails, leading to phishing attacks, reputational damage, and potential data breaches.

        Implementing SPF records aligns with security best practices and compliance requirements, such as:
          - ISO/IEC 27001 (A.13.2.3: Electronic messaging)
          - NIST 800-53 (SC-7: Boundary Protection)
          - CIS Controls (CIS Control 9: Email and Web Browser Protections)

        Ensuring SPF records are published for all Exchange domains strengthens email security, reduces the risk of spoofing, and enhances trust in email communications.

        **To setup SPF records for Exchange Online accepted domains, perform the following steps:**

        1. If all email in your domain is sent from and received by Exchange Online, add the following TXT record for each Accepted Domain:

        ```
        v=spf1 include:spf.protection.outlook.com -all
        ```

        2. If there are other systems that send email in the environment, ensure the SPF record includes all authorized email-sending systems. For example:

        ```
        v=spf1 include:spf.protection.outlook.com include:<other-system> -all
        ```

        3. Use the Microsoft 365 Defender portal to validate your SPF record configuration.

        This check ensures that no third-party integrated applications can connect to your services.

        **Why this matters**

        Allowing third-party integrated applications to connect to your services can introduce security risks, such as unauthorized access, data leakage, or exploitation of vulnerabilities in the third-party applications. Restricting third-party integrations helps maintain control over your organization's data and reduces the attack surface.

        By preventing third-party applications from connecting, organizations can ensure that only trusted and approved applications are used. This aligns with security best practices and compliance requirements, such as:
          - ISO/IEC 27001 (A.13.1.1: Network controls)
          - NIST 800-53 (AC-3: Access Enforcement)
          - CIS Controls (CIS Control 14: Controlled Access Based on the Need to Know)

        Ensuring that third-party integrated applications are not allowed strengthens the organization's security posture and minimizes the risk of unauthorized access or data breaches.
