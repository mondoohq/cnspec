        # Overview

        The Mondoo Okta Security policy bundle provides security recommendations for Okta organizations. This policy supports scanning of Okta organizations as well as Terraform projects using the [Okta Terraform provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/okta/okta/latest/docs) from the HashiCorp Terraform Registry.

        ## About remote scanning

        Remote scans with cnspec provide on demand security assessments of infrastructure and services without the need to install any agents or integrations. cnspec comes with a growing list of providers to connect and scan local and remote targets.

        A complete list of providers can be found by running the following command:

        ```bash
        cnspec scan --help
        ```

        ### cnspec Okta provider

        This policy uses the `okta` provider to authenticate with Okta's API in order to remotely scan an Okta organization. Additional information on the `okta` provider can be found by running the following command:

        ```bash
        cnspec scan okta --help
        ```

        ## Configuring the Okta provider

        The `okta` provider for cnspec requires an API token to authenticate and run scans.

        ### Create an API token

        To create an API token, see [Create an API token](https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/create-an-api-token/main/) on Okta's documentation site.

        ### Configure a OKTA_TOKEN environment variable

        You supply your API token to cnspec using the `OKTA_TOKEN` environment variable.

        #### Linux / macOS

        ```bash
        export OKTA_TOKEN=<OKTA_TOKEN>
        ```

        #### Windows
        ```powershell
        $Env:OKTA_TOKEN = "<OKTA_TOKEN>"
        ```

        ## Scan an Okta organization

        To scan the configuration of an Okta organization all together:

        ```bash
        cnspec scan okta --organization DOMAIN.okta.com --token $OKTA_TOKEN  -f okta-security-healthinsights.mql.yaml
        ```

        ## Scan Terraform HCL code managing Okta with the Terraform provider for Okta

        ```
        cnspec scan terraform /path/to/terraform -f okta-security-healthinsights.mql.yaml
        ```

        ## Scan Terraform plan file Okta with the Terraform provider for Okta

        Generate a Terraform plan.json file to scan:

        ```
        terraform plan -out plan.tfplan
        terraform show -json plan.tfplan > tfplan.json
        ```

        Scan Terraform plan file

        ```
        cnspec scan terraform plan /path/to/plan.json -f okta-security-healthinsights.mql.yaml
        ```

        ## Scan Terraform state file Okta with the Terraform provider for Okta

        Generate a Terraform state.json file to scan:

        ```
        terraform show -json > tfstate.json
        ```

        Scan Terraform state file:

        ```
        cnspec scan terraform state /path/to/tfstate.json -f okta-security-healthinsights.mql.yaml
        ```

    docs:
      desc: |
        Admin roles allow you to control user access to a range of Okta functions. You can assign more than one role to an individual admin if their job requires them to perform actions that span multiple roles. This role can create other admins, assign or remove permissions, and perform all other admin activities. The super admin has the highest permissions of all admin roles.

        ## Okta Recommends

        Limit the number of super admins only to users who require super admin access. An org shouldn't have more than:

        - 50 percent of admins have super admin privileges
        - 15 super admins

        All other admins should only have the permissions as required for their role.

        Plan for a recurring assessment of all admin privileges to ensure that these best practices are met.

    title: Enable Okta ThreatInsight to block suspicious IP addresses
    impact: 100
    docs:
      desc: |
        Configure network blocklisting to deny access from known malicious IP addresses or locations from your Okta org.

        Admins can block access to their Okta org to IP addresses coming from network zones, IP zones, and dynamic zones. Network zones contain a list of IP addresses, and dynamic zones contain a list of locations, ASNs, or IP types. Okta doesn't allow blocklisted IP addresses to access any of your org's URLs. Okta blocks these requests before any type of policy evaluation occurs.

        ### Okta recommends

        Block any known untrusted IP addresses, locations, or proxy servers to limit access to your org. If your org uses IP Trust for network zones, Okta also recommends blocking any IP addresses that are identified as a Tor anonymizer proxy. Only add IP addresses or locations that aren't associated with legitimate user activity.

        ### Security impact

        Moderate

        ## User impact

        Low

        Legitimate users within your org see no change in behavior. Clients connecting from blocked network zones see a 403 (access denied) error.

    docs:
      desc: |
        Enable strong MFA factors to improve resistance to phishing and man-in-the-middle attacks.

        Admins can configure multifactor authentication (MFA) at the organization level or application level. When users sign in to Okta or an app, they're prompted to authenticate themselves. If you deploy strong factors, they provide better protection against phishing, adversary-in-the-middle attacks, and others.

        ### Okta recommends

        Update factor enrollment policies based on the following:

        - Enable as primary factors: Okta Verify (with Push if available), Google Authenticator, WebAuthn
        - Don't enable as secondary factors: Security Questions and SMS/Email/Voice

        ### Security impact

        High

        ### User impact

        High

        When signing in to their org, end users are prompted to enroll in required factors and may enroll in any factors set to optional. Factors that have been disabled aren't visible to end users.

        Okta Verify is a multifactor authentication (MFA) app developed by Okta. It lets users verify their identity when they sign in to Okta and makes it less likely that someone pretending to be the user can gain access to the account.

        To use Okta Verify, you must first enable and configure it for your org, and then your end users must install the Okta Verify app on their device and set it up. Then, when end users sign in to Okta, they can verify their identity by approving a push notification in the app, or by entering a one-time code provided by the app into Okta.

        Enabling at least one required factor for your org ensures that end users assigned to a given policy are enrolled in MFA.

        Once a required factor is set, you can also update your Okta sign-on policy to prompt users to enroll in the factor the next time they sign in.

        ### Okta recommends

        If a factor is required as part of the MFA enrollment policy, end users must enroll in the factor before they can sign in to their org. Setup varies depending on the factor specified.

    impact: 100
    docs:
      desc: |
        SAML and OIDC are authentication protocols that reduce reliance on password-based authentication.

        SAML is an XML-based standard for exchanging authentication and authorization data between an Identity Provider (IdP) and a service provider (SP).
        OpenID Connect (OIDC) is a protocol that sits on top of the OAuth 2.0 framework. The OIDC protocol allows otherwise different systems to interoperate and share authentication state and user profile information.
        SWA is an SSO system developed by Okta to provide single sign-on for apps that don't support proprietary federated sign-on methods or SAML. In a SWA login, the username and password are passed to the third-party app whereas with SAML and OIDC, those credentials never leave Okta.

        ### Okta recommends

        Enable SAML or OIDC and disable SWA for applications when possible.

        ### Security impact

        High

        ### User impact

        None

        When signing in to their org, end users are prompted to enroll in required factors and may enroll in any factors set to optional. Factors that have been disabled aren't visible to end users.

            ### Enable or disable Security Notification emails
            If you disable this feature, all valid links expire immediately.

            If you disable the Report suspicious activity via email option, the Report Suspicious Activity button is removed from the email templates that use it.

            When you enable the Report suspicious activity via email option, events reported when users select the Report Suspicious Activity button appear on the Admin Console. Select Review Security Event to view the event details in the System Log. The event name is:

            ```
            user.account.report_suspicious_activity_by_enduser
            ```

            The following email templates include the Report Suspicious Activity button:

            - New Sign-On Notification
            - Authenticator Enrolled
            - Authenticator Reset
            - Password Changed

            1. In the Admin Console, go to SecurityGeneral.
            2. In the Security notification emails section, select Edit.
            3. Select either Enabled or Disabled from the dropdown beside the option that you want to enable or disable.
            4. Select Save.

        When enabled, this email notification notifies end users of any sign-in activity. The email contains user sign-on details such as the web browser, operating system used to sign in, and time and location of authentication.

        ### Okta Recommends

        Enable this email notification so end users are informed about new sign-on activity, which can inform them if a different user has signed in to their account.

        ### Security impact

        ### User impact

        Low

        End users receive an email notification if they sign in from a new or unrecognized client.

        ### Known limitations
        Currently, new sign-on notifications don't use Improved New Device Behavior Detection when sending email notifications for new sign-ins. Changes to `deviceToken` or browser cookies may not trigger a new sign-on email notification.

        Specify a minimum password length of at least eight characters. Longer passwords provide greater protection against brute force attacks.

        Longer passwords are more difficult for users to remember, especially when combined with other complexity requirements (for example, require uppercase, lowercase, symbols, and so on). NIST recommends longer passwords that are easy to remember (“phrase-like”) but more difficult to obtain from brute force attacks.

        These recommendations are provided by Okta as an example of typical password standards. They're derived from current cybersecurity industry best practices. They aren't intended to replace internationally recognized cybersecurity standards, such as ISO 27001, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), PCI-DSS, or others. Your IT department may need to adjust these settings to comply with whichever cybersecurity standard your organization has chosen to follow.

        Specify the maximum number of invalid password attempts before locking the user's account. This provides protection against brute-force password attacks.

        Users will be unable to access their accounts after multiple failed sign-ins.

        Admins configure the account unlock options in the lockout options in password policy rules.

        If an admin doesn't enable any self-service or auto-unlock options, users must ask their admin to unlock their account.

        When admins configure lockout policies, they should consider typical user sign-in patterns and security to determine how many attempts are allowed. A lockout policy that allows only a low number of attempts may cause more lockouts. For example, users may mistype passwords when signing in from a mobile device or when they've recently changed their passwords. Some applications may auto-retry cached passwords when they're changed, resulting in user lockouts. However, a lockout policy with too many attempts allowed increases the risk of credential attacks.
