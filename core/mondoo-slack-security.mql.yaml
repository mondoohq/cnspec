        ## Overview

        The Slack Team Security by Mondoo policy ensures that Slack Teams configurations follow best security practices.

        ### Prerequisites

        To run this query pack, you need access to the Slack API. This requires creating a new app in the Slack workspace, so you can retrieve a token.

        1. Sign in to [the Slack website](https://api.slack.com/apps/) and view **Your Apps**.
        2. Select **Create New App**.
        3. Select **From scratch**.
        4. Enter an app name (such as `cnquery`), select the workspace, then select **Create App**.
        5. In the **Add features & functionality** section, select **Permissions**.
        6. Scroll to **Scopes** and select **User Token Scopes**.

          Note: Bots are very limited in their access so you must assign user scopes.

        7. Add the required permissions to **User Token Scopes**:

          | OAuth Scope  |
          | ---- |
          | [channels:read](https://api.slack.com/scopes/channels:read) |
          | [groups:read](https://api.slack.com/scopes/groups:read) |
          | [im:read](https://api.slack.com/scopes/im:read) |
          | [mpim:read](https://api.slack.com/scopes/mpim:read) |
          | [team:read](https://api.slack.com/scopes/team:read) |
          | [usergroups:read](https://api.slack.com/scopes/usergroups:read) |
          | [users:read](https://api.slack.com/scopes/users:read) |

        8. Scroll up to **OAuth Tokens for Your Workspace** and select **Install to Workspace**.
        9. Copy the provided **User OAuth Token**. It looks like this: `xoxp-1234567890123-1234567890123-1234567890123-12345cea5ae0d3bed30dca43cb34c2d1`

        ### Run cnspec using this policy

        To run this policy against a Slack workspace:

        ```bash
        export SLACK_TOKEN=xoxp-TOKEN
        cnspec scan slack --policy-bundle mondoo-slack-security.mql.yaml
        ```

        Alternatively, you can use the CLI flag to connect to your Slack workspace:

        ```bash
        cnspec scan slack --token TOKEN --policy-bundle mondoo-slack-security.mql.yaml
        ```

        ## Note:
        You need to set the two properties in this policy to some values that make sense for your organizations.
        Modify the blocks below as needed:

        ```mql
          - uid: externalChannelName
            title: Enter your naming pattern for externally shared Slack channels
            mql: |
              return /ext|extern|ex_/
          - uid: allowListedDomains
            title: Enter allowed domains here
            mql: |
              return /mondoo.com|example.com/
        ```

        ## Join the community!

        Our goal is to build policies that are simple to deploy, accurate, and actionable.

        If you have any suggestions for improving this policy or if you need support, join [the Mondoo community in GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/mondoohq/discussions).

    docs:

        Having more than one administrator account is especially important to avoid single points of failure. For larger organizations, it's also useful to have several administrators to share the workload. More than 4 admins, however, creates unnecessary risk.
      audit: |
        Run on of these commands to learn the number of admins:

        __cnspec run__

        To audit Slack with `cnspec run`:

        Run this query:

          ```bash
          cnspec run slack -c "slack.users.admins.length" --token TOKEN
          ```

        __cnspec shell__

        To audit Slack with `cnspec shell`:

        1. Launch `cnspec shell`:

          ```bash
          cnspec shell slack ---organization --token TOKEN
          ```

        2. Run this query:

          ```mql
          slack.users.admins.length
          ```
      remediation: |
        Adjust the number of users who have admin privileges to be between 2 and 4. To learn how, read [Change a member's role](https://slack.com/help/articles/218124397-Change-a-members-role) in the Slack documentation.

    docs:

        Administrator accounts should use more secure two-factor authentication, using an authentication application like Authy. They should not rely on SMS verification, which is prone to SIM swapping attacks.
      audit: |
        Run one of these commands to learn which factors admins use:

        __cnspec run__

        To audit Slack with `cnspec run`:

        Run this query:

          ```bash
          cnspec run slack -c "slack.users.admins {has2FA twoFactorType name}" --token TOKEN
          ```

        __cnspec shell__

        To audit Slack with `cnspec shell`:

        1. Launch `cnspec shell`:

          ```bash
          cnspec shell slack ---organization --token TOKEN
          ```

        2. Run this query:

          ```mql
          slack.users.admins {has2FA twoFactorType name}
          ```
      remediation: |
        Make sure that all admin accounts use authentication applications for two-factor authentication rather than SMS. To learn about setting up two-factor authentication to use an application, read [Set up two-factor authentication](https://slack.com/help/articles/204509068-Set-up-two-factor-authentication) in the Slack documentation.

        __cnspec run__

        To audit Slack with `cnspec run`:

        Run this query:

          ```bash
          cnspec run slack -c "slack.users.where(enterpriseUser == null || id !="USLACKBOT") {has2FA twoFactorType name}" --token TOKEN

          ```
      remediation: |
        Make sure that all users have some form of two-factor authentication enabled. To learn about setting up two-factor authentication, read [Set up two-factor authentication](https://slack.com/help/articles/204509068-Set-up-two-factor-authentication) in the Slack documentation.

      audit: |
        Run one of these commands to verify all externally shared channels adhere to your naming pattern.
        Note: You must specify your custom naming pattern in the properties of this policy `props.externalChannelName`.
