    docs:
      desc: |-
        This policy setting determines the number of renewed, unique passwords that have to be associated with a user account before you can reuse an old password. The value for this policy setting must be between 0 and 24 passwords. The default value for Windows Vista is 0 passwords, but the default setting in a domain is 24 passwords. To maintain the effectiveness of this policy setting, use the Minimum password age setting to prevent users from repeatedly changing their password.

        The recommended state for this setting is: `24 or more password(s)`.

        **Note:**
        Password Policy settings (section 1.1) and Account Lockout Policy settings (section 1.2) must be applied via the **Default Domain Policy**
        GPO in order to be globally in effect on **domain**
        user accounts as their default behavior. If these settings are configured in another GPO, they will only affect **local**
        user accounts on the computers that receive the GPO. However, custom exceptions to the default password policy and account lockout policy rules for specific domain users and/or groups can be defined using Password Settings Objects (PSOs), which are completely separate from Group Policy and most easily configured using Active Directory Administrative Center.

        **Note #2:**
        As of the publication of this benchmark, Microsoft currently has a maximum limit of 24 saved passwords. For more information, please visit [Enforce password history (Windows 10) - Windows security \| Microsoft Docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/security-policy-settings/enforce-password-history#:~:text=The%20Enforce%20password%20history%20policy,a%20long%20period%20of%20time.)
      remediation: |-
        To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to `24 or more password(s)`:

        ```
        Computer Configuration\\Policies\\Windows Settings\\Security Settings\\Account Policies\\Password Policy\\Enforce password history
        ```

        **Impact:**

        The major impact of this configuration is that users must create a new password every time they are required to change their old one. If users are required to change their passwords to new unique values, there is an increased risk of users who write their passwords somewhere so that they do not forget them. Another risk is that users may create passwords that change incrementally (for example, password01, password02, and so on) to facilitate memorization but make them easier to guess. Also, an excessively low value for the Minimum password age setting will likely increase administrative overhead, because users who forget their passwords might ask the help desk to reset them frequently.

    docs:

        This policy setting defines how long a user can use their password before it expires.

        Values for this policy setting range from 0 to 999 days. If you set the value to 0, the password will never expire.

        Because attackers can crack passwords, the more frequently you change the password the less opportunity an attacker has to use a cracked password. However, the lower this value is set, the higher the potential for an increase in calls to help desk support due to users having to change their password or forgetting which password is current.

        The recommended state for this setting is `365 or fewer days, but not 0`.

        **Note:**

        ```

        **Impact:**

        If the Maximum password age setting is too low, users are required to change their passwords very often. Such a configuration can reduce security in the organization, because users might write their passwords in an insecure location or lose them. If the value for this policy setting is too high, the level of security within an organization is reduced because it allows potential attackers more time in which to discover user passwords or to use compromised accounts.

        This policy setting determines the number of days that you must use a password before you can change it. The range of values for this policy setting is between 1 and 999 days. (You may also set the value to 0 to allow immediate password changes.) The default value for this setting is 0 days.

        The recommended state for this setting is: `1 or more day(s))`.

    mql: |
      secpol.systemaccess['MinimumPasswordLength'] >= 14
    docs:
      desc: |-
        This policy setting determines the least number of characters that make up a password for a user account. There are many different theories about how to determine the best password length for an organization, but perhaps "passphrase" is a better term than "password." In Microsoft Windows 2000 and newer, passphrases can be quite long and can include spaces. Therefore, a phrase such as "I want to drink a $5 milkshake" is a valid passphrase; it is a considerably stronger password than an 8 or 10 character string of random numbers and letters, and yet is easier to remember. Users must be educated about the proper selection and maintenance of passwords, especially with regard to password length. In enterprise environments, the ideal value for the Minimum password length setting is 14 characters, however you should adjust this value to meet your organization's business requirements.

        The recommended state for this setting is: `14 or more character(s)`.

        **Note:**
        In Windows Server 2016 and older versions of Windows Server, the GUI of the Local Security Policy (LSP), Local Group Policy Editor (LGPE) and Group Policy Management Editor (GPME) would not let you set this value higher than 14 characters. However, starting with Windows Server 2019, Microsoft changed the GUI to allow up to a 20 character minimum password length.

        **Note #2:**
        Password Policy settings (section 1.1) and Account Lockout Policy settings (section 1.2) must be applied via the **Default Domain Policy**
        GPO in order to be globally in effect on **domain**

        Computer Configuration\\Policies\\Windows Settings\\Security Settings\\Account Policies\\Password Policy\\Minimum password length
        ```

        **Impact:**

        Requirements for extremely long passwords can actually decrease the security of an organization, because users might leave the information in an insecure location or lose it. If very long passwords are required, mistyped passwords could cause account lockouts and increase the volume of help desk calls. If your organization has issues with forgotten passwords due to password length requirements, consider teaching your users about passphrases, which are often easier to remember and, due to the larger number of character combinations, much harder to discover.

        **Note:**
        Older versions of Windows such as Windows 98 and Windows NT 4.0 do not support passwords that are longer than 14 characters. Computers that run these older operating systems are unable to authenticate with computers or domains that use accounts that require long passwords.

      secpol.systemaccess['PasswordComplexity'] == 1
    docs:
      desc: |-
        This policy setting checks all new passwords to ensure that they meet basic requirements for strong passwords.

        When this policy is enabled, passwords must meet the following minimum requirements:

        - Not contain the user's account name or parts of the user's full name that exceed two consecutive characters
        - Be at least six characters in length
        - Contain characters from three of the following categories:
        - English uppercase characters (A through Z)
        - English lowercase characters (a through z)
        - Base 10 digits (0 through 9)
        - Non-alphabetic characters (for example, !, $, #, %)
        - A catch-all category of any Unicode character that does not fall under the previous four categories. This fifth category can be regionally specific.


        Each additional character in a password increases its complexity exponentially. For instance, a seven-character, all lower-case alphabetic password would have 267 (approximately 8 x 109 or 8 billion) possible combinations. At 1,000,000 attempts per second (a capability of many password-cracking utilities), it would only take 133 minutes to crack. A seven-character alphabetic password with case sensitivity has 527 combinations. A seven-character case-sensitive alphanumeric password without punctuation has 627 combinations. An eight-character password has 268 (or 2 x 1011) possible combinations. Although this might seem to be a large number, at 1,000,000 attempts per second it would take only 59 hours to try all possible passwords. Remember, these times will significantly increase for passwords that use ALT characters and other special keyboard characters such as "!" or "@". Proper use of the password settings can help make it difficult to mount a brute force attack.

        The recommended state for this setting is: `Enabled`.

        **Note:**
        Password Policy settings (section 1.1) and Account Lockout Policy settings (section 1.2) must be applied via the **Default Domain Policy**
        GPO in order to be globally in effect on **domain**

        user accounts on the computers that receive the GPO. However, custom exceptions to the default password policy and account lockout policy rules for specific domain users and/or groups can be defined using Password Settings Objects (PSOs), which are completely separate from Group Policy and most easily configured using Active Directory Administrative Center.

        **Impact:**

        If the default password complexity configuration is retained, additional help desk calls for locked-out accounts could occur because users might not be accustomed to passwords that contain non-alphabetic characters. However, all users should be able to comply with the complexity requirement with minimal difficulty.

        If your organization has more stringent security requirements, you can create a custom version of the Passfilt.dll file that allows the use of arbitrarily complex password strength rules. For example, a custom password filter might require the use of non-upper row characters. (Upper row characters are those that require you to hold down the SHIFT key and press any of the digits between 1 and 0.) A custom password filter might also perform a dictionary check to verify that the proposed password does not contain common dictionary words or fragments.

        Also, the use of ALT key character combinations can greatly enhance the complexity of a password. However, such stringent password requirements can result in unhappy users and an extremely busy help desk. Alternatively, your organization could consider a requirement for all administrator passwords to use ALT characters in the 0128 - 0159 range. (ALT characters outside of this range can represent standard alphanumeric characters that would not add additional complexity to the password.)

For more information please see the following [Microsoft Security Blog](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-security-baselines/security-baseline-draft-windows-10-and-windows-server-version/ba-p/1419213).

        The recommended state for this setting is: `Enabled`.

        This setting is only available within the built-in OS security template of Windows 10 Release 2004 (or newer), and is not available via older versions of the OS, or via downloadable Administrative Templates (ADMX/ADML). Therefore, you _must_
        use a Windows 10 Release 2004 computer (or newer) to view or edit this setting with the Group Policy Management Console (GPMC) or Group Policy Management Editor (GPME).

        **Impact:**

        The _Minimum password length_
        setting may be configured higher than 14 characters.

        If very long passwords are required, mistyped passwords could cause account lockouts and increase the volume of help desk calls. If your organization has issues with forgotten passwords due to password length requirements, consider teaching your users about passphrases, which are often easier to remember and, due to the larger number of character combinations, much harder to discover.

        This policy setting determines whether the system shuts down if it is unable to log Security events. It is a requirement for Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria (TCSEC)-C2 and Common Criteria certification to prevent auditable events from occurring if the audit system is unable to log them. Microsoft has chosen to meet this requirement by halting the system and displaying a stop message if the auditing system experiences a failure. When this policy setting is enabled, the system will be shut down if a security audit cannot be logged for any reason.

        If the Audit: Shut down system immediately if unable to log security audits setting is enabled, unplanned system failures can occur. The administrative burden can be significant, especially if you also configure the Retention method for the Security log to Do not overwrite events (clear log manually). This configuration causes a repudiation threat (a backup operator could deny that they backed up or restored data) to become a denial of service (DoS) vulnerability, because a server could be forced to shut down if it is overwhelmed with logon events and other security events that are written to the Security log. Also, because the shutdown is not graceful, it is possible that irreparable damage to the operating system, applications, or data could result. Although the NTFS file system guarantees its integrity when an ungraceful computer shutdown occurs, it cannot guarantee that every data file for every application will still be in a usable form when the computer restarts.

        This setting determines if online identities are able to authenticate to this computer.

        The Public Key Cryptography Based User-to-User (PKU2U) protocol introduced in Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 is implemented as a security support provider (SSP). The SSP enables peer-to-peer authentication, particularly through the Windows 7 media and file sharing feature called HomeGroup, which permits sharing between computers that are not members of a domain.

        With PKU2U, a new extension was introduced to the Negotiate authentication package, `Spnego.dll`. In previous versions of Windows, Negotiate decided whether to use Kerberos or NTLM for authentication. The extension SSP for Negotiate, `Negoexts.dll`, which is treated as an authentication protocol by Windows, supports Microsoft SSPs including PKU2U.

        When computers are configured to accept authentication requests by using online IDs, `Negoexts.dll`
        calls the PKU2U SSP on the computer that is used to log on. The PKU2U SSP obtains a local certificate and exchanges the policy between the peer computers. When validated on the peer computer, the certificate within the metadata is sent to the logon peer for validation and associates the user's certificate to a security token and the logon process completes.

        LAN Manager (LM) was a family of early Microsoft client/server software (predating Windows NT) that allowed users to link personal computers together on a single network. LM network capabilities included transparent file and print sharing, user security features, and network administration tools. In Active Directory domains, the Kerberos protocol is the default authentication protocol. However, if the Kerberos protocol is not negotiated for some reason, Active Directory will use LM, NTLM, or NTLMv2. LAN Manager authentication includes the LM, NTLM, and NTLM version 2 (NTLMv2) variants, and is the protocol that is used to authenticate all Windows clients when they perform the following operations:

        - Join a domain
        - Authenticate between Active Directory forests
        - Authenticate to down-level domains
        - Authenticate to computers that do not run Windows 2000, Windows Server 2003, or Windows XP
        - Authenticate to computers that are not in the domain

        The Network security: LAN Manager authentication level setting determines which challenge/response authentication protocol is used for network logons. This choice affects the level of authentication protocol used by clients, the level of session security negotiated, and the level of authentication accepted by servers.

        The recommended state for this setting is: `Send NTLMv2 response only. Refuse LM & NTLM`.
      remediation: |-

        **Impact:**

        Clients use NTLMv2 authentication only and use NTLMv2 session security if the server supports it; Domain Controllers refuse LM and NTLM (accept only NTLMv2 authentication). Clients that do not support NTLMv2 authentication will not be able to authenticate in the domain and access domain resources by using LM and NTLM.

If this problem persists, it could indicate a network issue or that packets are being modified in transit to this computer. Verify that the packets sent from the remote computer are the same as those received by this computer. This error might also indicate interoperability problems with other IPsec implementations.

        - 4962: IPsec dropped an inbound packet that failed a replay check. The inbound packet had too low a sequence number to ensure it was not a replay.
        - 4963: IPsec dropped an inbound clear text packet that should have been secured. This is usually due to the remote computer changing its IPsec policy without informing this computer. This could also be a spoofing attack attempt.
        - 4965: IPsec received a packet from a remote computer with an incorrect Security Parameter Index (SPI). This is usually caused by malfunctioning hardware that is corrupting packets. If these errors persist, verify that the packets sent from the remote computer are the same as those received by this computer. This error may also indicate interoperability problems with other IPsec implementations. In that case, if connectivity is not impeded, then these events can be ignored.

This poses a potential security risk because some of the network interfaces may not get the protection provided by the applied IPsec filters.

        This setting controls whether local accounts can be used for remote administration via network logon (e.g., NET USE, connecting to C$, etc.). Local accounts are at high risk for credential theft when the same account and password is configured on multiple systems. Enabling this policy significantly reduces that risk.

        **Enabled:**
        Applies UAC token-filtering to local accounts on network logons. Membership in powerful group such as Administrators is disabled and powerful privileges are removed from the resulting access token. This configures the `LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy` registry value to `0`. This is the default behavior for Windows.

        **Disabled:**
        Allows local accounts to have full administrative rights when authenticating via network logon, by configuring the `LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy` registry value to `1`.

        By default, this setting will use a self-signed certificate for RDP connections. If your organization has established the use of a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) for SSL/TLS encryption, then we recommend that you also configure the _Server authentication certificate template_setting to instruct RDP to use a certificate from your PKI instead of a self-signed one. Note that the certificate template used for this purpose must have “Client Authentication” configured as an Intended Purpose. Note also that a valid, non-expired certificate using the specified template must already be installed on the workstation for it to work.

        Some third party two-factor authentication solutions (e.g. RSA Authentication Agent) can be negatively affected by this setting, as the SSL/TLS security layer will expect the user's Windows password upon initial connection attempt (before the RDP logon screen), and once successfully authenticated, pass the credential along to that Windows session on the RDP host (to complete the login). If a two-factor agent is present and expecting a different credential at the RDP logon screen, this initial connection may result in a failed logon attempt, and also effectively cause a “double logon” requirement for each and every new RDP session.

        When event logs fill to capacity, they will stop recording information unless the retention method for each is set so that the computer will overwrite the oldest entries with the most recent ones. To mitigate the risk of loss of recent data, you can configure the retention method so that older events are overwritten as needed.

        The consequence of this configuration is that older events will be removed from the logs. Attackers can take advantage of such a configuration, because they can generate a large number of extraneous events to overwrite any evidence of their attack. These risks can be somewhat reduced if you automate the archival and backup of event log data.

        Ideally, all specifically monitored events should be sent to a server that uses Microsoft System Center Operations Manager (SCOM) or some other automated monitoring tool. Such a configuration is particularly important because an attacker who successfully compromises a server could clear the Security log. If all events are sent to a monitoring server, then you will be able to gather forensic information about the attacker's activities.

        Local Security Authority (LSA) protection is a security feature in Microsoft Windows operating systems that helps to prevent credential theft and other types of attacks that can compromise system security.

        The LSA is responsible for enforcing security policies and managing various security-related tasks, such as authentication and authorization, on a local system. It stores sensitive information such as passwords, user account information, and security tokens.

        LSA protection enhances the security of these sensitive information by restricting access to the LSA subsystem to authorized processes only. It prevents malicious software from accessing or manipulating the LSA, thereby reducing the risk of credential theft and other types of attacks.

        LSA protection is implemented through the use of several techniques such as code integrity checks, access controls, and system call filtering. These techniques work together to prevent unauthorized access and ensure that only trusted processes can interact with the LSA subsystem.

        Overall, LSA protection is an important security feature that helps to secure Windows systems and protect against various types of attacks that can compromise system security.
      remediation: |-
        Enable LSA protection via GPO:

          - Open the Group Policy Management Console (GPMC).
          - Create a new GPO that is linked at the domain level or that is linked to the organizational unit that contains your computer accounts. Or you can select a GPO that is already deployed.
          - Right-click the GPO, and then click Edit to open the Group Policy Management Editor.
          - Expand Computer Configuration, expand Preferences, and then expand Windows Settings.
          - Right-click Registry, point to New, and then click Registry Item. The New Registry Properties dialog box appears.
          - In the Hive list, click HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE.
          - In the Key Path list, browse to SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa.
          - In the Value name box, type RunAsPPL.
          - In the Value type box, click the REG_DWORD.
          - In the Value data box, type 00000001.
          - Click OK.
