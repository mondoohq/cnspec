        ## Overview
        This policy provides prescriptive guidance for establishing a secure configuration posture for Windows Client systems running on x86 and x64 platforms.

        Commands and scripts are provided which should work on Windows 10 and 11.

        ### Intended Audience

        This benchmark is intended for system and application administrators, security specialists, auditors, help desk, and platform deployment personnel who plan to develop, deploy, assess, or secure solutions that incorporate Windows on x86 or x64 platforms.

        ## Local scan

        Local scan refer to scans of files and operating systems where `cnspec` is installed.

        To scan the `localhost` against this policy:

        ```bash
        cnspec scan local
        ```

        ## Remote scan

        Remote scans use native transports in `cnspec` to provide on demand scan results without the need to install any agents, or integration.

        For a complete list of native transports run:

        ```bash
        cnspec scan --help
        ```

        ### Prerequisites

        Remote scans of Linux hosts requires authentication such as SSH keys.

        ### Scan a remote Windows system (SSH authentication)

        ```bash
        cnspec scan ssh <user>@<IP_ADDRESS> --ask-pass
        ```

        Encryption processes encode data in a manner that makes it unusable to unauthorized users who do not have the decryption key. The main advantage of encryption is that it turns data into an unreadable form that cannot be used when the notebook is stolen. Windows offers BitLocker, which enables you to encrypt entire drives and prevent unauthorized system changes.
        Microsoft designed bitLocker to provide encryption for disk volumes. It is a free and built-in feature in many Windows versions, including Windows Vista and Windows 10. BitLocker asks users for a password, generates a recovery key, and encrypts the entire hard drive.
      remediation: |
        Turn on device encryption

        1. Sign in to Windows with an administrator account (you may have to sign out and back in to switch accounts). For more info, see Create a local or administrator account in Windows.

        2. Select the Start  button, then select Settings  > Update & Security > Device encryption. If Device encryption doesn't appear, it isn't available. You may be able to use standard BitLocker encryption instead. Open Device encryption in Settings.

        3. If device encryption is turned off, select Turn on.

        Turn on standard BitLocker encryption

        1. Sign in to your Windows device with an administrator account (you may have to sign out and back in to switch accounts). For more info, see Create a local or administrator account in Windows.

        2. In the search box on the taskbar, type Manage BitLocker and then select it from the list of results. Or, select the Start  button, and then under Windows System, select Control Panel. In Control Panel, select System and Security, and then under BitLocker Drive Encryption, select Manage BitLocker.

        Note: You'll only see this option if BitLocker is available for your device. It isn't available on Windows 10 Home edition.

        3. Select Turn on BitLocker and then follow the instructions.

        Auto updates are important for Windows because they help to ensure the security and stability of the operating system. Here are some of the key reasons why auto updates are important:

        Security: Updates often contain security patches that help protect your computer from vulnerabilities that could be exploited by hackers or malware. By keeping your system up to date, you reduce the risk of being hacked or having your personal data compromised.

        Bug fixes: Updates can also fix bugs and other issues that can cause crashes or other problems. By keeping your system up to date, you ensure that you have access to the latest fixes and improvements, which can help improve performance and reliability.

        New features: Updates can also introduce new features and improvements to the Windows operating system. By keeping your system up to date, you ensure that you have access to these new features and can take advantage of the latest advancements in technology.

        Overall, auto updates are important for Windows because they help keep your system secure, stable, and up to date with the latest features and improvements.

        Under

        ```
        Computer Configuration\Administrative Templates\Windows Components\Windows update\Configure Automatic Updates
        ```

        , you must select one of the following options:

        2 - Notify for download and auto install - When Windows finds updates that apply to this device, users will be notified that updates are ready to be downloaded. After going to Settings > Update & security > Windows Update, users can download and install any available updates.

        3 - Auto download and notify for Install - Windows finds updates that apply to the device and downloads them in the background (the user is not notified or interrupted during this process). When the downloads are complete, users will be notified that they are ready to install. After going to Settings > Update & security > Windows Update, users can install them.

        4 - Auto download and schedule the install - Specify the schedule using the options in the Group Policy Setting. For more information about this setting, see Schedule update installation.

        5 - Allow local admin to choose setting - With this option, local administrators will be allowed to use the settings app to select a configuration option of their choice. Local administrators will not be allowed to disable the configuration for Automatic Updates. This option is not available in any Windows 10 or later versions.

        7 - Notify for install and notify for restart (Windows Server 2016 and later only) - With this option, when Windows finds updates that apply to this device, they will be downloaded, then users will be notified that updates are ready to be installed. Once updates are installed, a notification will be displayed to users to restart the device.

        ```powershell
        $keypath = "Registry::HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WindowsUpdate\AU"
        $keyname = "NoAutoUpdate"
        New-Item -Path $keypath -Name $keyname -Force
        Set-ItemProperty -Path $keypath -Name $keyname -Value "4"
        ```

        Configure Scheduled install day for every day (set to 0) under

        ```
        Computer Configuration\Policies\Administrative Templates\Windows Components\Windows Update\Manage end user experience\Configure Automatic Updates: Scheduled install day
        ```

        ```powershell
        $keypath = "Registry::HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WindowsUpdate\AU"
        $keyname = "ScheduledInstallDay"
        New-Item -Path $keypath -Name $keyname -Force
        Set-ItemProperty -Path $keypath -Name $keyname -Value "0"
        ```

        Critical operating system updates and service packs will automatically download every day (at 3:00 A.M., by default).

        Complete the following steps to turn on Microsoft Defender Antivirus on your device.

        1. Select the Start menu.
        2. In the search bar, type Group Policy. Then select Edit Group Policy from the listed results. The Local Group Policy Editor opens.
        3. Select Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Windows Components > Microsoft Defender Antivirus.
        4. Scroll to the bottom of the list and select Turn off Microsoft Defender Antivirus.
        5. Select Disabled or Not configured. It might feel counter-intuitive to select these options because the names suggest that you're turning Microsoft Defender Antivirus off. Don't worry, these options actually ensure that it's turned on.
        6. Select Apply > OK.

        If running these manually, they must be run line by line in order to function properly.
