        The Mondoo VMware vCenter policy checks for vulnerable vCenter/ESXi configuration. It should be used in combination with the Platform Vulnerability Policy to identify missing patches.

        ### Run policy

        To run this policy against VMware vCenter:

        ```bash
        cnspec scan vsphere user@domain.local@192.168.5.24 --ask-pass -f core/mondoo-vmware-vulnerability.mql.yaml
        ```
