Now that you have an introduction to [assessing your AWS security](/cnspec/cloud/aws/account/) with cnspec, let's dive deeper and test EC2 instances.

## Scan EC2 instances

To scan your EC2 instances against security policies:

```bash
cnspec scan aws --discover instances
```

To scan EC2 instances in a specific region:

```bash
cnspec scan aws --discover instances --region us-west-2
```

## Explore EC2 in the cnspec shell

We'll continue working in the cnspec shell, which makes running individual queries easy. If it's not already open, enter `cnspec shell aws` in your terminal. To learn about accessing your AWS account with cnspec, read [Assess AWS Security](/cnspec/cloud/aws).

## EC2 resources

cnspec lets you test any configuration detail of your EC2 instances. To discover all the resources and fields you can query, read [aws.ec2](/mql/resources/aws#aws.ec2). You can also use the `help` command in the shell:

```bash
help aws.ec2
```

## Run tests on EC2 instances

### No public IPs

This test assesses whether any running EC2 instances have a public IP:

```bash
aws.ec2.instances.all( state = "running" && publicIp != empty )
```

If the test passes (no running instances have a public IP) then cnspec returns `ok`:

```coffeescript
[ok] value: true`
```

If the test fails, (one or more running instances have a public IP) then cnspec provides details about the failure:

```coffeescript
[failed] [].all()
  actual:   [
    0: aws.ec2.instance id = arn:aws:ec2:us-east-1:177043751234:instance/i-0fde6c8e0210b7i26
    1: aws.ec2.instance id = arn:aws:ec2:us-east-1:177043751234:instance/i-01d9ac4d064722qa4
  ]
```

### More examples

This test verifies that all EC2 instances require HTTP tokens:

```
aws.ec2.instances.all(httpTokens == "required")
```

This test ensures that no EBS snapshots are publicly restorable:

```bash
aws.ec2.snapshots.all(createVolumePermission.none(_['Group'] == "all" ))
```
