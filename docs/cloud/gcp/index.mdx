cnspec assesses your full Google Cloud environment for misconfigurations that put your organization at risk. You can scan your Google Cloud account for compliance with security policies created by Mondoo or the community, or [create your own policies](/cnspec/write-policies/write-intro). You also can write individual tests to run on the fly or include in automated tasks.

cnspec can test any aspect of your Google Cloud configuration. For a list of Google Cloud resources you can test, read [Mondoo Google Cloud (GCP) Resource Pack Reference](/mql/resources/gcp/) and [Mondoo Core Resource Pack Reference](/mql/resources/core/).

  You can also use cnspec with HashiCorp Packer to [build secure VM images in Google
  Cloud](/cnspec/cloud/gcp/packer/).

## Connect cnspec with your Google Cloud environment

### Requirements

To test your Google Cloud environment with cnspec, you must have:

- [cnspec installed on your workstation](/cnspec/)
- A [Google Platform account](https://cloud.google.com/free)
- [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/install) installed
- [Cloud Resource Manager API](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/google/cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com) enabled

### Provide access credentials

In your terminal, log into Google Cloud with this command:

```bash
gcloud auth login  --update-adc
```

### Configure the Google Cloud project you want assess

To test a Google Cloud project, you must set up the project:

```bash
gcloud config set project PROJECTID
```

For `PROJECTID`, substitute the ID of the project you want to assess.

Google Cloud confirms the setup:

```bash
Updated property [core/project].
```

To verify your configuration, enter:

```shell
gcloud config list
```

Google Cloud returns results similar to these:

```ini
[core]
account = suki@lunalectric.com
disable_usage_reporting = True
project = gcp-project-id

Your active configuration is: [default]
```

### Verify with a quick Google Cloud check

To quickly confirm that cnspec has access to your Google Cloud environment, run this check from your terminal:

```bash
cnspec run gcp project PROJECT-ID -c 'gcp.project.id!="foo"'
```

For `PROJECT-ID`, substitute your Google Cloud project ID.

It asserts that your Google Cloud project ID value is not `foo`.

cnspec returns `[ok]` to indicate that the test passed, and includes the actual value of the GCP project ID, similar to this:

```coffeescript
[ok] value: "luna-dev-262317"
```

You've successfully used cnspec to run your first check on your Google Cloud environment. Now you're ready to explore.

Once you've ensured that [cnspec can access your Google Cloud environment](/cnspec/cloud/gcp/), you can begin testing. The method you choose depends on your goals:

- For widescale assessment of your Google Cloud infrastructure, scan using policy bundles. These collections of tests work together to present a broad picture of your GCP security posture.
- To run ad hoc checks against your Google Cloud environment, use cnspec's interactive shell. It has auto-complete to guide you, which is especially helpful when you're new to cnspec and learning MQL.

## Assess Google Cloud security with policy-based scanning

The Google Cloud (GCP) Security by Mondoo policy is available to all in Mondoo's [cnspec-policies GitHub repo](https://github.com/mondoohq/cnspec-policies/tree/main/core). This collection of tests evaluates how well your environment follows fundamental GCP security best practices. It checks for misconfigurations across your entire GCP infrastructure.

To scan an organization using the Google Cloud (GCP) Security by Mondoo policy, run:

```bash
cnspec scan gcp org ORGANIZATION-ID
```

For `ORGANIZATION-ID`, substitute the ID of the organization you want to scan.

To scan a project using the Google Cloud (GCP) Security by Mondoo policy, run:

```bash
cnspec scan gcp project PROJECT-ID
```

For `PROJECT-ID`, substitute the ID of the project you want to scan.

To scan a folder using the Google Cloud (GCP) Security by Mondoo policy, run:

```bash
cnspec scan gcp folder FOLDER-ID
```

For `FOLDER-ID`, substitute the ID of the folder you want to scan.

cnspec finds the default policy for GCP and runs a scan based on that policy. It returns a report summarizing the scan results.:

You can also create your own policies to meet your specific needs. To learn more about policies, read [Policies](/cnspec/policies-about).

## Test GCP with the cnspec shell

The cnspec shell is handy for quick checks and tests, or for developing your MQL skills. Its auto-complete and help features guide you in writing checks.

To launch a shell into your GCP environment to run queries and checks, substitute ORGANIZATION-ID with the ID of the organization you want to access and run:

```bash
cnspec shell gcp org ORGANIZATION-ID
```

To launch a shell into your GCP environment on the project level, substitute PROJECT-ID with the ID of the project you want to access and run:

```bash
cnspec shell gcp project PROJECT-ID
```

To launch a shell into your GCP environment on the folder level, substitute FOLDER-ID with the ID of the folder you want to access and run:

```bash
cnspec shell gcp folder FOLDER-ID
```

### Discover capabilities with the `help` command

Once inside the shell, use the `help` command to learn what GCP resources you can test. This command lists all the GCP resources:

```bash
help gcp
```

From the resulting list, you can drill down further. For example, enter this command to list all the GCP service resources you can test:

```bash
help gcp.service
```

From the resulting list, you can drill down even further. You can also learn about available GCP resources in the [Mondoo Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Resource Pack Reference](/mql/resources/gcp/).

### Run tests in the cnspec shell

Now that you know how to discover what's possible with cnspec, let's run some actual tests in the shell.

#### Assess Cloud Storage bucket access

This test assures that all Cloud Storage buckets have uniform bucket-level access enabled:

```coffeescript
gcp.project.storageService.buckets.all( iamConfiguration['UniformBucketLevelAccess']['Enabled'] == true )
```

If the test passes (all Cloud Storage buckets have uniform bucket-level access enabled) then cnspec returns `ok`:

```coffeescript
[ok] value: true
```

If the test fails, (one or more Cloud Storage buckets don't use uniform bucket-level access) then cnspec provides details about the failure:

```coffeescript
[failed] [].all()
  actual:   [
    0: gcp.project.storageService.bucket id = luna-bucket-3
  ]
```

The sample results above show that the `luna-bucket-3` storage bucket doesn't use uniform bucket-level access.

#### Assess Compute Engine access

This test asserts that all Compute Engine instances have OS Login enabled:

```coffeescript
gcp.project.computeService.instances.all( metadata['enable-oslogin'] == true )
```

If one or more instance aren't using OS Login, cnspec lists them:

```coffeescript
[failed] [].all()
  actual:   [
    0: gcp.project.computeService.instance id = gcp.project.computeService.instance/luna-dev-262313/5894326198680570314
    1: gcp.project.computeService.instance id = gcp.project.computeService.instance/luna-dev-262313/7160119628481766684
    2: gcp.project.computeService.instance id = gcp.project.computeService.instance/luna-dev-262313/5917688252380140477

    5: gcp.project.computeService.instance id = gcp.project.computeService.instance/luna-dev-262313/4114342986437780688
    6: gcp.project.computeService.instance id = gcp.project.computeService.instance/luna-dev-262313/9121791747047534080
    7: gcp.project.computeService.instance id = gcp.project.computeService.instance/luna-dev-262313/2350609386795184202
    8: gcp.project.computeService.instance id = gcp.project.computeService.instance/luna-dev-262313/3078531271735985553
    9: gcp.project.computeService.instance id = gcp.project.computeService.instance/luna-dev-262313/1236920519697087164
    10: gcp.project.computeService.instance id = gcp.project.computeService.instance/luna-dev-262313/6674678823862797263
    11: gcp.project.computeService.instance id = gcp.project.computeService.instance/luna-dev-262313/3498829478465908910
  ]
