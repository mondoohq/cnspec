---

cnspec can assess the security of a GCP instance without affecting your production workload. It creates a snapshot of the instance, scans that snapshot, and then removes it.

To snapshot scan a GCP instance, you create a VM instance and scan from that VM. The VM instance from which you scan must have adequate permissions.

## Set up permissions for snapshot scanning

To create and scan a snapshot of a GCP instance, you must create a service account for the VM instance from which you execute the snapshot scan. The service account you create needs specific permissions, which you provide using a custom role.

1. In the [Google Cloud console](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/roles), create a new role named **cnspec-snapshot-scanner** with these permissions:
   - compute.disks.create
   - compute.disks.createSnapshot
   - compute.disks.delete
   - compute.disks.get
   - compute.disks.setLabels
   - compute.disks.use
   - compute.disks.useReadOnly
   - compute.instances.attachDisk
   - compute.instances.detachDisk
   - compute.instances.get
   - compute.snapshots.create
   - compute.snapshots.get
   - compute.snapshots.list
   - compute.snapshots.useReadOnly
   - compute.zoneOperations.get

   To learn how, read [Grant an IAM role by using the Google Cloud console](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/grant-role-console) in the GCP documentation.

2. In the [Google Cloud console](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectselector2/iam-admin/serviceaccounts), create a new service account and assign it these roles:
   - cnspec-snapshot-scanner
   - Service Account User

   To learn how, read [Create service accounts](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-accounts-create) in the GCP documentation.

## Create a VM from which to run a cnspec snapshot scan

In the [Google Cloud console](https://console.cloud.google.com/compute/instances), create a new VM instance using the service account you created in the previous steps. To learn how, read [Create a VM that uses a user-managed service account](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/access/create-enable-service-accounts-for-instances) in the GCP documentation.

<Callout type="info">
  You can create a VM instance template to make it easier to spin up VM
  instances for snapshot scanning. To learn how, read [Create instance
  templates](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instance-templates/create-instance-templates)
  in the GCP documentation.

## Create, scan, and destroy a snapshot

Connect to the VM instance you created in the steps above and then run:

```bash
cnspec scan gcp instance INSTANCE-NAME --project-id PROJECT-ID --zone INSTANCE-ZONE
```

Example:

```bash
cnspec scan gcp instance lunalectric-rover --project-id rover-123 --zone us-central1-a
```

## Scan an existing snapshot

cnspec lets you scan a specific, existing snapshot. This gives you insight into the instance's state at a particular point in time. You can also use the data to assess change over a span of time.

To scan an existing snapshot, you must be logged into the instance.

```bash
cnspec scan gcp snapshot SNAPSHOT-NAME --project-id PROJECT-ID
```

Example:

```bash
cnquery scan gcp snapshot suse12 --project-id rover-123
```
