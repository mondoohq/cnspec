cnspec assesses your full Kubernetes environment for misconfigurations that put your organization at risk. You can scan your Kubernetes clusters for compliance with security policies created by Mondoo or the community, or [create your own policies](/cnspec/write-policies/write-intro). You also can write individual tests to run on the fly or include in automated tasks.

You can also scan Kubernetes manifests to catch misconfigurations. Integrating manifest scanning in your development process can eliminate risks before they reach production.

For a list of Kubernetes resources you can test, read [Mondoo Kubernetes (k8s) Resource Pack Reference](/mql/resources/k8s/) and [Mondoo Core Resource Pack Reference](/mql/resources/core/).

## Connect cnspec with your Kubernetes environment

### Requirements

To test your Kubernetes environment with cnspec, you must have:

- [cnspec installed on your workstation](/cnspec/).
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/) installed on your workstation. To ensure that kubectl is successfully installed and you can access your Kubernetes infrastructure, run `kubectl describe nodes`.

## Scan a Kubernetes cluster

To scan your Kubernetes cluster against security policies:

```bash
cnspec scan k8s
```

To scan a specific namespace:

```bash
cnspec scan k8s --namespace my-namespace
```

To scan and discover all workloads:

```bash
cnspec scan k8s --discover all
```

### Verify with a quick Kubernetes check

To quickly confirm that cnspec has access to your Kubernetes environment, run this check from your terminal:

```bash
cnspec run k8s -c 'k8s.deployment.uid != "foo"'
```

This asserts that none of your deployments are named `foo`. cnspec returns a report listing your deployments. For each, it indicates whether the deployment meets the requirement (not named `foo`):

```coffeescript
[passed] k8s.deployment.uid != "foo"

[ok] value: "057e7351-5738-4d3b-bd5f-46d86403c563"

[ok] value: "8038b1f4-020d-4f3f-a1da-8ec86044b9d7"

[ok] value: "aadd280e-4498-4071-8fd0-1fad781a2d07"
```

## Next step

You've successfully used cnspec to run your first check against your Kubernetes infrastructure. Now you're ready to [explore more Kubernetes information.](/cnspec/cloud/k8s/cluster)
