Mondoo provides standalone binary builds of cnspec. The standalone binary is primarily for use on operating systems where there is no packaged installer available, or for automation use cases where a packaged installer would be superfluous.

<Callout>
  We recommend that, if possible, you use a [package-based installation](/cnspec/) so you can
  benefit from easy cnspec upgrades.

## Install using the cnspec binary

To download the cnspec binary, visit the [Release Page](https://releases.mondoo.com/cnspec/latest). Archive files are available for all supported architectures and operating systems.

Archives for UNIX-based systems are packaged as `.tar.gz` files. Archives for Windows systems are packaged as `.zip` files.
