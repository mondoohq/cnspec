Install Mondoo on all major Linux distributions and their derivative distributions:

- Amazon Linux
- Debian Linux
- Fedora
- Red Hat Enterprise Linux
- SUSE Linux Enterprise Server
- Ubuntu

## Prerequisites

Before you install cnspec or integrate Linux systems with Mondoo, you must:

- Confirm access to the internet using the terminal
- Confirm access to Mondoo systems using the terminal
- Synchronize your system clock

import Partial from './_providers-note.mdx';

### Confirm access to the internet using the terminal

Check internet connectivity from the terminal:

```powershell
curl -I https://mondoo.com
```

If you get the status **200 OK** and the website's headers, you internet connection is working.

If you have a proxy setting in your environment, you _might_ need to configure it in the terminal:

```
export http_proxy='http://proxyServerAddress:proxyPort'
export https_proxy='https://proxyServerAddress:proxyPort'
```

To make this configuration permanent, you can set the proxy in system-wide configuration files or user-based files like `/etc/bashrc`, `/etc/profile/`, and `/etc/profile.d/` based on your distribution.

### Confirm Mondoo systems access using the terminal

Be sure you have access to these systems from the terminal:

```powershell
install.mondoo.com                  Port 443/https
releases.mondoo.com                 Port 443/https
eu.api.mondoo.com                   Port 443/https
us.api.mondoo.com                   Port 443/https
registry.api.mondoo.com             Port 443/https
```

If your organization's [region](/platform/start/organize/regions/) (in the Mondoo Console) is US, you must be able to access us.api.mondoo.com. If your region is EU, you must be able to access eu.api.mondoo.com.

To check the connectivity, follow the approach in the previous section using the `curl` command.

### Synchronize your system clock

Make sure your system clock is in sync with your NTP or internet time:

```
ntpq -p
```

## Install cnspec on Linux

There are two ways of installing Mondoo on Linux:

### Option A: Install using the automated install script

The environment variable `MONDOO_REGISTRATION_TOKEN` allows you to pass a registration token to the installation package. If you provide this value, the agent automatically registers during the installation and creates mondoo.yml, the configuration file for Mondoo.

We recommend that you create an integration and retrieve a token from Mondoo:

1. Log into [the Mondoo Console](https://console.mondoo.com).

2. Create a new integration for your Linux machine:
   - If this is your first time logging in, select the **BROWSE INTEGRATIONS** button.
   - If you've accessed the console before, in the side navigation bar, under INTEGRATIONS, select Add New Integration. Under **Server and Endpoint Security**, select your operating system.

3. Copy the installation command including the registration token and run this in your terminal.

### Option B: Install manually using a package manager

# export MONDOO_REGISTRATION_TOKEN="<YOUR_TOKEN_HERE>"
apt update && apt install mondoo
```

## Understand the installation: binaries and files

When you complete the installation, you should have these three binaries on the machine:

- cnspec
- cnquery
- mondoo

To learn the location, run one of these commands:

```
which cnspec
which cnquery
```

Depending on your Linux distribution, the files can be in different locations, such as `/usr/bin/` in Debian/Ubuntu or `/bin/` in Red Hat/Fedora.

Note the location of the cnspec binary.

The installation also creates mondoo.yml, a configuration file that contains important data about the certificate, private key, API endpoint, and space address. These values come from the token (a JSON web token or JWT). You can check the content of the JWT using this command:

```bash
jq -R 'split(".") | .[1] | @base64d | fromjson' <<<  "<Token-Here>"
```

By default, the installation creates the mondoo.yml file here:

```bash
/etc/opt/mondoo/
```

It is important to check the cnspec status, configuration file, and registration status by running:

```bash
cnspec status
```

In new Linux distributions, the installation creates a systemd cnspec service, which you can see in:

```bash
/etc/systemd/system/cnspec.service
```

If you encounter an issue with the token, you can re-register cnspec with the new token:

```bash
cnspec login --token $MONDOO_REGISTRATION_TOKEN --config /etc/opt/mondoo/mondoo.yml
```

OR:

```bash
cnspec register --token $MONDOO_REGISTRATION_TOKEN --config /etc/opt/mondoo/mondoo.yml
```

## Enable and start cnspec as a service:

```bash
systemctl enable cnspec.service
systemctl start cnspec.service
systemctl daemon-reload
```

Each time the service starts, it runs a local scan based on the selected policies and sends the results to this machine's space in Mondoo Platform. You can then [view the results](/platform/security/posture/monitor/) in the Mondoo Console.

To force cnspec to continuously scan the machine, the binary runs with a option called **serve**, which runs cnspec as a daemon every hour.
See this in the cnspec.service:

```bash
[Unit]
Description=cnspec Service
After=network-online.target
StartLimitIntervalSec=280

[Service]
Type=simple
WorkingDirectory=/etc/opt/mondoo/
ExecStart=/usr/bin/cnspec --config /etc/opt/mondoo/mondoo.yml serve
KillMode=process
Restart=on-failure
RestartPreventExitStatus=78
StartLimitBurst=3
RestartSec=90

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
Alias=cnspec.service
```

To run the scan yourself and see the results as well, you can use this command:

```bash
cnspec scan local
```

During the scan, if cnspec finds a configuration file (mondoo.yml), it loads the policies enabled for this machine's space in Mondoo Platform. If cnspec doesn't find a configuration file, it scans based on Mondoo's free, open source policies. cnspec loads the policies into memory and runs the scan.

## Proxy configuration in cnspec

You can also set the proxy settings from within cnspec during registration or add them to the mondoo.yml configuration file.

During the registration:

```powershell title="Set Proxy via cnspec command"
cnspec login --token 'YOUR_TOKEN_HERE' --api-proxy 'http://1.1.1.1:8080' --config '/etc/opt/mondoo/mondoo.yml'
```

Add to the mondoo.yml file:

1. Navigate to the cnspec configuration file located at `/etc/opt/mondoo/mondoo.yml`.
2. Add this line:

```yaml title="Set Proxy via cnspec configuration file"
api_proxy: http://1.1.1.1:8080
```
