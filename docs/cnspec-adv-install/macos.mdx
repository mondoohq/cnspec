## Install using the automated install script

The Mondoo automated installation script installs the mondoo package using either the [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) package manager or a `.pkg` installer if Homebrew is unavailable.

```bash
# export MONDOO_REGISTRATION_TOKEN="<YOUR_TOKEN_HERE>"
bash -c "$(curl -sSL https://install.mondoo.com/sh)"
```

## Install directly via Homebrew

Mondoo supports installation using the [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) package manager on macOS.

```bash title="Add the Mondoo tap"
brew tap mondoohq/mondoo
```

```bash title="Install mondoo package with brew"
brew install mondoo
```

```bash title="Upgrade mondoo package with brew"
brew upgrade mondoo
```

## Install using the universal binary package

Mondoo releases a signed and notarized universal binary package (`.pkg`) for Intel & ARM (M1 and later) platforms available at [releases.mondoo.com](https://releases.mondoo.com/mondoo/latest) that installs cnspec on hosts.

Additionally, the package installs, but does not start or enable, a `launchd` configuration for running cnspec continuously as a service for endpoint security. This package is ideal for deployment by MDM solutions.

For more information on running Mondoo as a service on macOS, see [Running Mondoo as a service](/cnspec/cnspec-adv-install/service).

To install the PKG non-interactively use the _installer_ utility in a Terminal:

```bash
installer -pkg ./mondoo_(version)_darwin_universal.pkg -target /Library
```
