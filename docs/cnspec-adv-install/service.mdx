This document covers how to run cnspec as a service on hosts in your environment.

## Configure cnspec to run as a service

When configured as a service, cnspec continuously assesses hosts by running policies configured in Mondoo Platform. By default, every 60 minutes, cnspec service:

1. Connects to your account in the platform

2. Retrieves and validates the latest policies enabled for it.

3. Scans the host.

4. Reports scan results back to the platform.

<Tabs items={['Linux', 'Windows', 'macOS']}>
<Tab value="Linux">

The installation places a systemd unit file at `/etc/systemd/system/cnspec.service`. However, it does not register or enable the service.

<Callout type="info">

Before starting cnspec as a service, you should have already [registered the host](./registration.md) with your Mondoo Platform account.

</Callout>

#### Enable and start cnspec as a service

```bash title="1. Reload systemd daemon and load the cnspec.service unit file"
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

```bash title="2. Enable cnspec to run during startup"
sudo systemctl enable cnspec
```

```bash title="3. Start cnspec service"
sudo systemctl start cnspec
```

```bash title="4. Check the status of cnspec"
sudo systemctl status cnspec
```

#### cnspec service logging

cnspec service writes log events to the system logs. You can use this command to tail cnspec service logs on Linux hosts:

```bash title="Tail cnspec service logs"
sudo journalctl -u cnspec -f
```

The default log level is `info` but can be configured as defined in [cnspec Configuration options](#cnspec-configuration-options) below

</Tab>
<Tab value="Windows">

When installed on Windows, the mondoo package automatically registers with the Service Control Manager in Windows, but sets the default **Startup Type** to **Manual** and does not start the service.

#### Running as a service

Launch a PowerShell terminal as an administrator and run these commands:

<Callout type="info">

Before starting cnspec as a service, you should have already [registered the host](./registration.md) with your Mondoo Platform account.

</Callout>

```powershell title="1. Set mondoo service to run automatically at startup"
Set-Service -Name mondoo -StartupType Automatic
```

```powershell title="2. Start mondoo service"
Set-Service -Name mondoo -Status Running
```

```powershell title="3. Validate mondoo is running as a service"
Get-Service mondoo | Select-Object -Property Name, StartType, Status
```

#### Mondoo service logging

Mondoo service writes logging events to the Windows Event Viewer Application logs. To view logs:

![](/img/cnspec/installation/windows-event-viewer.png)

1. Select the **Start Menu** and launch **Event Viewer**
2. Expand **Windows Logs**
3. Select **Application** to view application logs
4. Use **Find...** to search for "cnspec"

</Tab>
<Tab value="macOS">
If you installed cnspec using the PKG installer, a launchd service is created automatically. If you installed cnspec using Homebrew, you can manually create the service plist file at /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.mondoo.client.plist:

```xml title="Create the com.mondoo.client.plist file"
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
	<key>Label</key>
	<string>com.mondoo.client</string>
	<key>ProgramArguments</key>
	<array>
		<string>/path/to/cnspec</string>
		<string>serve</string>
		<string>-t</string>
		<string>60</string>
		<string>--config</string>
		<string>/etc/opt/mondoo/mondoo.yml</string>
	</array>
	<key>RunAtLoad</key>
	<true/>
</dict>
</plist>
```

You must replace "/path/to/cnspec" with the path to cnspec on your host. You can validate this by opening a terminal and running `which cnspec`. Also, ensure you specify the correct path to Mondoo Platform config ("/etc/opt/mondoo/mondoo.yml" in the example above), which can be validated by opening a terminal and running `cnspec status`. Additionally, you can adjust the scan frequency (60 minutes by default).

```bash title="Load the Launchd Service"
sudo launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.mondoo.client.plist
```

To start, stop or check the status of the service, use the _launchctl_ tool:

```bash
$ sudo launchctl start com.mondoo.client
$ sudo launchctl list | grep cnspec
-	1	com.mondoo.client
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

## cnspec serve

In addition to leveraging the platform service management system, cnspec includes the `cnspec serve` command, which you can use on any supported platform (Linux, Windows, macOS) to continuously run assessments of hosts.

<Callout type="info">

cnspec serve leverages the default configuration of the host if already [registered](./registration.md).

</Callout>

### Set a custom scan interval

Use the `--timer` flag to set a scan interval in minutes. The default is 60. For example, this runs a scan with `cnspec serve` every 15 minutes:

```bash
cnspec serve --timer 15
```

## cnspec configuration options

cnspec configuration is stored on the host at this location:

- **Linux** - `/etc/opt/mondoo/mondoo.yml`
- **Windows** - `C:\ProgramData\Mondoo\mondoo.yml`

Common cnspec service configuration options:

| Name           | Description                                                                 |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `agent_mrn`    | Agent Mondoo resource name, identifies the client                           |
| `api_endpoint` | The URL of Mondoo Platform (`https://us.api.mondoo.com` is the default)     |
| `certificate`  | Client's public certificate                                                 |
| `loglevel`     | Service log level: error, warn, info, debug, trace (default is info)        |
| `mrn`          | Service Account Mondoo resource name, which identifies the service account  |
| `private_key`  | Client's private key used to sign requests sent to Mondoo Platform          |

## cnspec inventory

cnspec inventory configuration defines a list of targets for cnspec to scan. This example of the inventory.yml file contains an ssh-based scan with annotations:

```yaml title="inventory.yml"
apiVersion: v1
kind: Inventory
metadata:
  name: cnspec-ssh-inventory
  labels:
    environment: production
spec:
  assets:
    # linux with password authentication
    - id: linux-ssh-with-password
      connections:
        - host: 192.168.5.89
          type: ssh
          credentials:
            - type: password
              user: mondoo
              password: mondoo
      annotations:
        key: value
```

This example scans the local machine and all running containers:

```yaml title="inventory.yml"
apiVersion: v1
kind: Inventory
metadata:
  name: mondoo-inventory
  labels:
    environment: production
spec:
  assets:
    - id: docker-container
      connections:
        - type: local
          discover:
            targets:
              - "container"
```

This example scans the local machine and all container images:

```yaml title="inventory.yml"
apiVersion: v1
kind: Inventory
metadata:
  name: mondoo-inventory
  labels:
    environment: production
spec:
  assets:
    - id: docker-container
      connections:
        - type: local
          discover:
            targets:
              - "container-images"
```

This example scans the vSphere environment with embedded credentials:

```yaml title="inventory.yml"
apiVersion: v1
kind: Inventory
metadata:
  name: mondoo-inventory
  labels:
    environment: production
spec:
  assets:
    - name: vsphere
      connections:
        - type: vsphere
          host: 192.168.5.24
          credentials:
            - type: password
              user: mondoo-read@vsphere.local
              password: test
          discover:
            targets:
              - host-machines
```

This example scans the vSphere environment with extracted credentials and reference:

```yaml title="inventory.yml"
apiVersion: v1
kind: Inventory
metadata:
  name: mondoo-inventory
  labels:
    environment: production
spec:
  assets:
    - name: vsphere
      connections:
        - type: vsphere
          host: 192.168.5.24
          credentials:
            - secret_id: my-secret
          discover:
            targets:
              - host-machines
  credentials:
    my-secret:
      type: password
      user: mondoo-read@vsphere.local
      password: test
```

This example scans the vSphere environment with credentials from HashiCorp Vault:

```yaml title="inventory.yml"
apiVersion: v1
kind: Inventory
metadata:
  name: mondoo-inventory
  labels:
    environment: production
spec:
  assets:
    - name:
      connections:
        - type: vsphere
          host: 192.168.5.24
          insecure: true
          credentials:
            - secret_id: vcenter/mondoo-read
          discover:
            targets:
              - auto
      annotations:
        Owner: patrick@mondoo.com
  vault:
    name: cnspec-hashivault
    type: hashicorp-vault
    options:
      url: http://127.0.0.1:8200
      token: XXXXXXXX
```

Example to scan a Microsoft 365 account:

```yaml title="inventory.yml"
apiVersion: v1
kind: Inventory
metadata:
  name: mondoo-inventory
  labels:
    environment: production
spec:
  assets:
    - connections:
        - type: ms365
          credentials:
            - type: pkcs12
              private_key_path: "/Users/atomic111/Projects/presales/m365-scanning/certificate.combo.pem"
          options:
            client-id: c4b89770-5ed2-4367-b4f6-ff05ffcb3406
            organization: ""
            sharepoint-url: ""
            tenant-id: d9abc6fc-fd88-4480-a931-2f7939adbac2
          discover:
            targets:
              - auto
```

Example to scan an Azure tenant including all subscriptions:

```yaml title="inventory.yml"
apiVersion: v1
kind: Inventory
metadata:
  name: mondoo-inventory
  labels:
    environment: production
spec:
  assets:
    - connections:
        - type: azure
          credentials:
            - type: pkcs12
              private_key_path: "</Users/user/tmpjddt4b_y5.pem>"
          options:
            client-id: 9f51cb-66c3-4gg9-b525-fbd717384d96
            lun: "0"
            tenant-id: f115cf8c-a2d4-51ef-1234-56f7ed7e18ec
          discover:
            targets:
              - auto
```

Example to scan a Google Workspace account:

```yaml title="inventory.yml"
apiVersion: v1
kind: Inventory
metadata:
  name: mondoo-inventory
  labels:
    environment: production
spec:
  assets:
    - connections:
        - type: google-workspace
          credentials:
            - type: json
              secret: <base64 encoded secret>
          options:
            customer-id: D34dr1r
            impersonated-user-email: user@lunalectric.com
```

To execute cnspec with the inventory file, run this command:

```bash
cnquery scan --inventory-file ./inventory.yml
```

## cnspec inventory.yml template

cnspec inventory files are useful for a CI/CD pipeline. Inventory templates are useful for scanning different assets for different environments. They allow you to reuse the same template with a custom variable. This example uses the `getenv` function to include an environment variable (the asset name):

```yaml
spec:
  assets:
    - name: { { getenv "ASSET_NAME" } }
      connections:
        - type: local
          discover:
            targets:
              - auto
```

You can use this example inventory template by providing the `ASSET_NAME` and variable with the `cnspec scan` command and specifying the template:

```bash
ASSET_NAME="my_asset" cnspec scan --inventory-template template.yaml
```
