cnspec is a versioned binary. To identify the currently installed version of cnspec, run:

```
cnspec version
```

To learn about cnspec provider versioning, read [Manage cnspec Providers](/cnspec/cnspec-adv-install/providers/).

## How cnspec versioning works

Mondoo's versioning policy is _based on_ the semantic versioning standard. For example, in version 12.1.2, 12 is the major version, 1 is the minor version, and 2 is the patch. When we release a new version, we increment one of these three version components depending on the type of changes we introduce.

### Breaking changes policy

Major version releases of cnspec contain _soft-breaking_ changes. These may require you to update your policies, query packs, or automation scripts in order to avoid disruption, but you have a long time to make those updates. We provide advanced warning before we make these changes, and they don't become _hard-breaking_ changes until the next major release.

### Supported releases

cnspec follows an N-1 support cycle, meaning the current version (N) and the immediate previous version (N-1) are officially supported. During this time, both major versions can communicate with Mondoo Platform and execute all published policies and query packs. For example, if the current release of cnspec is 12.1.2, Mondoo Platform supports all versions from 11.0 through 12.1.2. When cnspec 13.0 is released, the minimum supported version will become 12.0, and all earlier 11.x releases will reach end of life (EOL).

## Update cnspec

To update cnspec to the latest version, you can use your preferred package manager, such as Homebrew or Chocolatey, or simply re-run the installation script.
