import { Callout } from "fumadocs-ui/components/callout";

<Callout type="info">
  The msi package `REGISTRATIONTOKEN` argument allows you to pass in a temporary
  registration token to the MSI installer. If the argument is provided, cnspec
  will be registered automatically during installation.
</Callout>

## Prerequisites

Before you integrate Microsoft Windows with Mondoo:

- Confirm access to the internet using PowerShell or CMD Terminal
- Confirm access to Mondoo systems using PowerShell or CMD Terminal
- Synchronize your system clock

import Partial from "./_providers-note.mdx";

<Partial />

### Access to the internet using PowerShell or CMD Terminal

<Callout type="info">

If your organization's [region](/platform/start/organize/regions/) (in the Mondoo Console) is US, you must be able to access us.api.mondoo.com. If your region is EU, you must be able to access eu.api.mondoo.com.

</Callout>

```powershell title="Check internet connectivity"
# from PowerShell
Test-NetConnection mondoo.com -Port 443

# from CMD terminal (activate telnet client if not already activated)
Telnet google.com 443
```

If you have a proxy setting in your environment, you _might_ need to configure it in the PowerShell and CMD Terminal:

```powershell title="Check proxy settings"
netsh winhttp show proxy
```

### Systems access

Be sure you have access to these systems from PowerShell or CMD Terminal:

```powershell title="Check the Internet connectivity"
install.mondoo.com                   Port 443/https
releases.mondoo.com                  Port 443/https
eu.api.mondoo.com                 Port 443/https
us.api.mondoo.com                 Port 443/https
registry.api.mondoo.com           Port 443/https
```

To check connectivity, follow the approach in the previous section.

### System clock sync

Make sure your system clock is in sync with your NTP or internet time:

```
w32tm /query /status
w32tm /query /peers
w32tm /resync
```

## Install cnspec on Windows

There are two ways of installing Mondoo on Windows:

### Option A: Install using the automated install script in PowerShell

Make sure TLS 1.2 is enabled (it's enabled by default in modern Windows systems):

```powershell title="TLS version"
# To check
[Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol

# If it is not enabled, enable it:
[Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12
```

Install cnspec by downloading a PowerShell script to memory and running it:

If you wish later the scan happens by loading the configured Policy from your Mondoo Console space, you need to register by having a registration token which will be given to you during integration from https://console.mondoo.com/.

Without RegistrationToken set, the policies will be automatically loaded from our registry of open source policies.

```powershell title="Automated installation script"
# $MONDOO_REGISTRATION_TOKEN="YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"
iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://install.mondoo.com/ps1'))
Install-Mondoo # -RegistrationToken $MONDOO_REGISTRATION_TOKEN
```

The installation creates one or two directories:

- The `C:\Program Files\Mondoo` directory contains binaries.
- The `C:\ProgramData\Mondoo` directory is only created if the registration token is used. It contains the `mondoo.yml` configuration file.

## Option B: Install manually (Mondoo package including cnspec)

1. Download the [Mondoo Windows installer](https://releases.mondoo.com/mondoo/latest).
2. Execute the installer as administrator.

   Example:

   ```powershell title="manual installation"
   # PowerShell
   Start-Process -Wait msiexec -ArgumentList ' /i  mondoo_12.8.1_windows_amd64.msi'

   # CMD Terminal
   start /wait msiexec /i mondoo_12.8.1_windows_amd64.msi
   ```

3. Follow the steps and agree to the license agreement.
4. (Optional) Register cnspec with your Mondoo Platform account.

   If you enter a registration token during the installation wizard, cnspec registers automatically.

   You can also register by token later if needed:

   ```powershell title="CMD Terminal"
   start /wait msiexec /i mondoo_12.8.1_windows_amd64.msi  REGISTRATIONTOKEN="XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
   ```

## Test and troubleshoot

Make sure the service is running and that it runs automatically at startup:

```powershell title="PowerShell"
Set-Service -Name mondoo -Status Running -StartupType Automatic
```

Validate that the service is running:

```
# PowerShell
Get-Service mondoo

# CMD terminal
sc query mondoo
```

Check the cnspec status:

```
cnspec status
```

If cnspec is already registered, you should see this line in the status:

```
loaded configuration from C:\ProgramData\Mondoo\mondoo.yml using source default
```

The `mondoo.yaml` file has the certificate, private key, and the api endpoint.

Scan the local system:

```
cnspec scan local
```

Here the cnspec will automatically load the policies from Mondoo Console spaces provided you have registered the mondoo with the token. Otherwise, the policies will be loaded from our registry.

You can also force the cnspec to load the policies only from registry:

```
cnspec scan local --incognito
```

Delete and reinstall:

In some situations, you might need to remove the services and install again.

```
sc stop mondoo
sc delete mondoo
rmdir  "C:\Program Files\Mondoo"
rmdir  "C:\ProgramData\Mondoo"
```

## Proxy configuration

cnspec also works behind a forward proxy, such as Squid.

```powershell title="Set https_proxy environment variable"
$env:https_proxy = "<ip-address>:<port>"
```

To set the proxy configuration for cnspec permanently, add the proxy configuration during cnspec registration:

```powershell title="Set Proxy via cnspec command"
cnspec login --token 'YOUR_TOKEN_HERE' --api-proxy 'http://1.1.1.1' --config 'C:\ProgramData\Mondoo\mondoo.yml'
```

Or add it to the cnspec configuration directly, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the cnspec configuration file under `C:\ProgramData\Mondoo\mondoo.yml`
2. Add this line:

```yaml title="Set Proxy via cnspec configuration file"
api_proxy: http://1.1.1.1
```
