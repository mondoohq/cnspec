You can expand your cnspec capabilities with a Mondoo Platform account. Mondoo Platform includes a web-based UI through which you can:

- Continuously monitor infrastructure security and compliance
- Save, review, search, and share scan results
- Access over 200 free security policies, including specific compliance checks against regional and industry guidelines
- Manage and share policies across your entire infrastructure
- Automatically scan your infrastructure with integrations for clouds, SaaS, IaC, Kubernetes and more
- Expose vulnerabilities on systems with vendor advisory and CVE support
- Take action on top findings with ticketing and automated remediations

This is just a partial list of capabilities. To learn more about what you can accomplish with Mondoo Platform, visit [mondoo.com](https://mondoo.com).

To get started, [contact Mondoo](https://mondoo.com/contact).

## Specify a proxy server for communication with Mondoo

You can specify a proxy server for communication between cnspec and Mondoo Platform. This is useful if your default system proxy restricts communication, or if you need to monitor different types of traffic.

1. Find the Mondoo configuration file: `/etc/opt/mondoo/mondoo.yml`.

2. Add this line to `mondoo.yml`:

   ```yaml
   api_proxy: https://1.1.1.1:8080
   ```
