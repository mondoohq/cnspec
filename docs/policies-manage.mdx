If you customize or build your own policies, you can store and share access to them using Mondoo Platform.

## Scale cnspec across your infrastructure

The easiest way to scale cnspec across your infrastructure is to have all of your infrastructure pull policies from a central location. One simple approach is to sign up for a free account on [Mondoo Platform](/start/what-is-mondoo/). The platform is designed for multi-tenancy and provides a secure, private environment that keeps data about your assets in your own account. With Mondoo Platform, all assets can report on policies and you can define custom exceptions for your infrastructure.

To use cnspec with Mondoo Platform, run:

```bash
cnspec login
```

Once authenticated, you can scan any target:

```bash
cnspec scan <target>
```

cnspec returns the results from the scan to STDOUT and to Mondoo Platform.

## Upload policies to your account

With an account on Mondoo Platform, you can upload policies:

```bash
cnspec policy upload mypolicy.mql.yaml
```

## Create a policy bundle

To learn about policies and policy bundles, read [Policies](/cnspec/policies-about).

To set up a new policy bundle:

```bash
cnspec bundle init example.mql.yaml
```

## Validate a policy bundle

Validate a policy bundle to ensure that the bundle compiles and that all queries and references work:

```bash
cnspec bundle validate example.mql.yaml
```
