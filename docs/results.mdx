cnspec supports different ways of reporting scan results. You can generate a JSON report or view and print results in the Mondoo Console.

## Create a JSON report from the command line

To save the results of your scan to a JSON file, append your scan command with the `-o` flag:

```
-o json > FILENAME.json
```

For `FILENAME`, substitute the name you want to give the file. For example, this scans a Kubernetes cluster and reports the results to a file named `k8s-test-results.json`:

```bash
cnspec scan k8s -o json > k8s-test-results.json
```

## View and print results in the Mondoo Console

When cnspec completes a scan, it provides a link to the Mondoo Console, where you can view graphical results.
