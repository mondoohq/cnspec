---

The [Amazon Elastic Container Registry](https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/) allows you to store container images within AWS. To learn about the AWS container registry, read the [Getting Started Guide](https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/getting-started/) in the AWS documentation.

When it scans an AWS account, cnspec can automatically discover and scan all ECR images in the account.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have your AWS credentials configured properly:

```bash
$ cat ~/.aws/credentials

[default]
aws_access_key_id = AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE
aws_secret_access_key = wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY

[mondoo]
aws_access_key_id = AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE
aws_secret_access_key = wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY
```

If you want to use a specific profile, set `AWS_PROFILE`

```bash
export AWS_PROFILE=mondoo
```

You can also set the region:

```bash
export AWS_REGION=us-east-1
```

## Scan

After we completed the login, cnspec can scan the registry:

```bash
$ cnspec scan aws --discover ecr
→ loaded configuration from /Users/letha/.config/mondoo/mondoo.yml using source default
→ using service account credentials
→ discover related assets for 1 asset(s)
→ synchronize assets
