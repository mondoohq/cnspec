Filters can specify what target assets a policy, group, check, or query can run against. A filter is simply a condition, written in [MQL](/mql/mql-write), that must be met. Any fields you can query about any [resources](/mql/resources/) can be the basis for a filter.

The most common basis for filters is platform information. For example, you can add a filter that tells cnspec to run a policy only on AWS EKS clusters. Or you can add a filter that tells cnspec to run a check only on certain versions of an operating system.

  Filters are an essential part of creating variants. To learn about variants, read [Make Policies
  Flexible with Variants](/cnspec/write-policies/variants).
</Callout>
## Apply a filter to a check or query

Add `filters` information to a check or query to apply a filter to it.

This is an example of a check with a filter:

```yaml
- uid: ssh-root-login-is-disabled
  title: Ensure SSH root login is disabled
  filters: package('openssh-server').installed
  impact: 90
  mql: sshd.config.params["PermitRootLogin"] == "no"
```

The filter in the `ssh-root-login-is-disabled` check tells cnspec to run the check only on assets that have the SSH Server package installed. When scanning an asset without SSH Server, cnspec skips this check.

## Apply a filter to a chapter or group

Add `filters` information to a group to apply a filter to it.

This is an example of a [chapter](/cnspec/write-policies/chapters) type of group with two filters:

```yaml
groups:
  - title: AWS Compute Services
    type: chapter
    filters: |
      asset.name == "aws"
      asset.kind == "api"
    checks:

    ...

```

Unless the asset is an AWS compute service, cnspec skips all the checks and queries in this group when scanning the asset.

## More examples of filters

This filter limits scans to only GCP projects:

```coffeescript
asset.platform == "gcp-project"
```

This filter limits scans to only kubelets:

```coffeescript
asset.family.contains('linux')
processes.where( executable == /kubelet/ ).list != []
```

To learn how to write your own filters, read [Write Effective MQL](/mql/mql-write) and the [MQL Reference](/mql/resources/).
