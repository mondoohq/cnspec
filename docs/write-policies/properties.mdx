Properties are an optional method of defining the ideal values for [checks](/cnspec/write-policies/simple/#checks). Instead of defining a value in the check itself, you can define it in a property and reference that property in the check. Multiple checks in a policy can share a single property.

This policy does not use properties. It checks that you have strong IAM policies in AWS:

```yaml showLineNumbers
policies:
  - uid: no-properties-example
    name: Example policy without properties
    version: "1.0.0"
    authors:
      - name: Lunalectric
        email: security@lunalectric.com
    groups:
      - title: group01
        checks:
          - uid: aws-iam-01
            title: Require long passwords
            mql: aws.iam.accountPasswordPolicy['MinimumPasswordLength'] >= 8

          - uid: aws-iam-02
            title: Require uppercase characters
            mql: aws.iam.accountPasswordPolicy['RequireUppercaseCharacters'] == true

          - uid: aws-iam-03
            title: Limit password age
            mql: aws.iam.accountPasswordPolicy['MaxPasswordAge'] <= 90
```

The `no-properties-example` policy above performs three checks:

- Line 13 checks whether the minimum password length is set to 8 or higher.

- Line 17 checks whether uppercase letters are required in passwords.

- Line 21 checks whether passwords expire after 90 or fewer days.

In each of these lines, the ideal value that the policy checks against is in the check itself.

An alternate way to structure these checks is to put all the ideal values in properties. You define properties separately from the checks themselves&mdash;similar to defining variables in code.

This policy shows how you can use properties to achieve the same results as the `no-properties-example` policy:

```yaml showLineNumbers
policies:
  - uid: example-with-properties
    name: Example policy using properties
    version: "1.0.0"
    authors:
      - name: Lunalectric
        email: security@lunalectric.com
    groups:
      - title: group01
        checks:
          - uid: aws-iam-01
            title: Require long passwords
            mql: aws.iam.accountPasswordPolicy['MinimumPasswordLength'] >= props.passwordMinLength

          - uid: aws-iam-02
            title: Require uppercase character
            mql: aws.iam.accountPasswordPolicy['RequireUppercaseCharacters'] == props.passwordUppercase

          - uid: aws-iam-03
            title: Require password rotation
            mql: aws.iam.accountPasswordPolicy['MaxPasswordAge'] <= props.passwordMaxAge
props:
  - uid: passwordMinLength
    title: Minimum password length
    mql: "8"

  - uid: props.passwordUppercase
    title: Whether to require at least one uppercase character in passwords
    mql: "true"

  - uid: props.passwordMaxAge
    title: Maximum time that a user can go without changing their password
    mql: "90"
```

In the `example-with-properties` policy above, the three checks refer to properties for the ideal values to check against. The `props` sections of the policy (beginning on line 21) assigns a value to each of the three properties.

import Partial from "./_include-lint.mdx";

## Use one property for multiple checks

Multiple checks in a policy can share a single property. This can make updates easier when your organization's requirements change.

As a simple example, suppose you create a policy that checks IAM best practices across multiple platforms. Even though the platforms are different, your company's minimum password length requirement is the same. If you create password length checks for each different platform, you don't need to define the minimum password length value multiple times. Instead, all of the password length checks can point to a single property. That way, there's only one value to change when your company's minimum password length requirement changes.
