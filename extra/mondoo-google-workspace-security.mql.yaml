        ## Overview

        The Mondoo Google Workspace Security policy by Mondoo ensures that Google Workspace configurations follow best security practices.

        ### Prerequisites

        1. Create/Select a GCP project
        2. Navigate to the [Google API Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/dashboard).
        3. Select \"Enable APIs and Services\" and enable the following APIs:
          - Admin SDK API
          - Cloud Identity API
          - Google Calendar API
          - Google Drive API
          - Gmail API

        ### Run policy

        To run this policy against a Google Workspace customer:

        ```bash
        export GOOGLEWORKSPACE_CREDENTIALS=$PWD/my-project-123456-1234ea722b12.json
        cnspec scan google-workspace --customer-id <CUSTOMERID> --impersonated-user-email <EMAIL>
        ```

        All user accounts should be protected with two-factor authentication. This enhances protection against account takeovers by attackers.

        Run one of the following commands to see the enforcement and enrollment status of 2FA for all users:

        __cnspec run__

        To audit Google Workspace with `cnspec run`:

        Run the following query:

          ```bash
          cnspec run google-workspace --customer-id <CUSTOMERID> --impersonated-user-email <EMAIL> -c "googleworkspace.users { fullName primaryEmail isEnforcedIn2Sv isEnrolledIn2Sv isAdmin }"
          ```

        __cnspec shell__

        To audit Google Workspace with `cnspec shell`:

        1. Launch `cnspec shell`:

          ```bash
          cnspec shell google-workspace --customer-id <CUSTOMERID> --impersonated-user-email <EMAIL>

          ```

        2. Run the following query:

          ```mql
          googleworkspace.users { fullName primaryEmail isEnforcedIn2Sv isAdmin }
          ```
      remediation: |
        Make sure that all users have some form of two-factor authentication enabled.

        For larger organizations, it's useful to have several administrators to share the workload. Having more than 4 super admins, however, creates unnecessary risk.

    docs:
      desc: |
        Less secure apps do not use modern security standards like OAuth, which increases the risk of compromised accounts and devices. By locking down these apps and devices, you increase data safety.
      audit: |
        Run one of the following commands to display all users which are allowed access to less secure apps. (This will return `[]` if there are none.):

        __cnspec run__

        To audit Google Workspace with `cnspec run`:

        Run the following query:

          ```bash
          cnspec run google-workspace --customer-id <CUSTOMERID> --impersonated-user-email <EMAIL> -c "googleworkspace.report.users.where(security["isLessSecureAppsAccessAllowed"] != false) {fullName primaryEmail}"
          ```

        __cnspec shell__

        To audit Google Workspace with `cnspec shell`:

        1. Launch `cnspec shell`:

          ```
      remediation: |
        Make sure to block the usage of less secure apps in Google Workspace. To learn how, read [Control access to less secure apps](https://support.google.com/a/answer/6260879?hl=en) in the Google Workspace documentation.

    title: Super users should use hardware-based security keys
    mql: googleworkspace.report.users.where(security["isSuperAdmin"] == true).all(security["numSecurityKeys"] >= 1)
    impact: 70
    docs:
      desc: |
        All user accounts should be protected with two-factor authentication. This enhances protection against account takeovers by attackers. Furthermore high-value accounts such as Super Admins should be protected by hardware-based security keys as their second factor. They should not rely on SMS verification, which is prone to SIM swapping attacks.
      audit: |
        Run one of the following commands to see the enforcement and enrollment status of 2FA for all users:

        __cnspec run__

        To audit Google Workspace with `cnspec run`:

        Run the following query:

          ```bash
          cnspec run google-workspace --customer-id <CUSTOMERID> --impersonated-user-email <EMAIL> -c "googleworkspace.report.users.where(security["isSuperAdmin"] == true) {security["numSecurityKeys"] userEmail}"
          ```

        __cnspec shell__

        To audit Google Workspace with `cnspec shell`:

        1. Launch `cnspec shell`:

          ```bash
          cnspec shell google-workspace --customer-id <CUSTOMERID> --impersonated-user-email <EMAIL>

          ```

        2. Run the following query:

          ```mql
          googleworkspace.report.users.where(security["isSuperAdmin"] == true) {security["numSecurityKeys"] userEmail}
          ```
      remediation: |
        Make sure that all high-value targets such as Super Admins have some form of two-factor authentication enabled. Also make sure that they are using security keys for the 2-Step verification process. To learn about setting up security keys for the 2-Step verification process, read [Use a security key for 2-Step Verification] (https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6103523?hl=En).
