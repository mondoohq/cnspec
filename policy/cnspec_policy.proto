  // 1. Contextual risks
  //
  // - Internet-facing asset   [internet-facing]
  //   Any assets that are facing the internet may be at risk of being breached
  //
  // - Asset or service in use   [asset-in-use]
  //   Assets or services that are currently being used. If vulnerabilities
  //   are found on an asset in use, their priority is increased. However,
  //   vulnerabilities on an asset not in use may be reduced in priority.
  //
  // - Exploitable vulnerabilities   [exploitable]
  //   Exploitable vulnerabilities are detected on the asset. These are more
  //   likely to lead to a breach.
  //
  // - Code Execution risks   [code-execution]
  //   Vulnerabilities are detected which contain (remote) code executions.
  //   These can cause serious damage to other resources on the asset.
  //
  // - End of life   [eol]
  //   The asset or some of its resources have reach their end of life and
  //   no longer receive security updates. Vulnerability analysis is
  //   unreliable and may not be actionable.
  //
  // - Defensive countermeasures   [defensive]
  //   Defensive countermeasures have been detected on the asset. These may
  //   contain security modules, firewalls, or other mitigations.
  //
  // 2. Downstream exposure
  //
  // - DB access   [db-access]
  //   Databases are downstream exposures that may hold valuable customer data
  //
  // - User risks   [user-risk]
  //   Users, often with elevated privileges, that are at risk
  //
  // - Sensitive data   [sensitive-data]
  //   The asset contains sensitive data, which an attacker may access if
  //   they manage to breach it.
  //
  // - Credential risks   [credentials]
  //   Credentials are found on the asset that attackers may use to elevate
  //   their privileges or breach other systems.
  //
  // - Containers or Kubernetes   [containers]
  //   Containers or Kubernetes environments are found ont he asset. Attackers
  //   may expand their attacks to these virtual systems.
  //
  // - Packages [package]
  //   The asset contains software packages that are at risk or has other
  //   related risks such as incompletely removed packages.
  //
  // - Ports [port]
  //   The asset has processes listening on open or public ports.
  //
  // 3. Misc
  //
  // - Tagged assets   [tagged]
  //   Tagged assets may be increased or decreased in priority, depending on
  //   a users' needs. For example: Critical production infrastructure may
  //   increase the risk of findings.
  //
  // - Other risks   [uncategorized]
